/**
 * Heap Data Structure
 * -------------------
 * A specialized tree-based data structure maintaining the heap property:
 * - Min-Heap: Parent nodes have values less than or equal to children's values.
 * - Max-Heap: Parent nodes have values greater than or equal to children's values.
 * Implemented often using arrays.
 */

// Core Operations on Heap:
// 1. Insertion: Adding elements while preserving the heap property.
// 2. Extraction: Retrieving minimum/maximum element without violating heap property and restructuring the heap.

/**
 * Applications of Heap Data Structure
 * ----------------------------------
 * 1. Priority Queues: Efficiently handle highest/lowest priority elements.
 * 2. Heap Sort: Sorting algorithm utilizing heap properties.
 * 3. Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm: Shortest path finding with priority queue.
 * 4. Memory Allocation: Efficient allocation/deallocation of memory blocks.
 * 5. Event-driven Simulation: Schedule events based on priority.
 * 6. Graph Algorithms: Used in algorithms like Prim's and Kruskal's for minimum spanning trees.
 */

// Advantages of Heap Data Structure:
// - Efficiency: Logarithmic time complexity for peek and poll operations.
// - Space Efficiency: Can be implemented using arrays, consuming less memory.

/**
 * Summary:
 * Heaps are versatile data structures with applications in various domains,
 * providing efficient handling of priority-based operations, sorting, memory management,
 * and algorithm design, making them crucial in computer science and software development.
