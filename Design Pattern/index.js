    Design patterns are standardized solutions to common problems in software design. 
    They represent best practices that can be used to address recurring issues in software 
    development. Design patterns are not complete solutions but templates that can be adapted 
    to fit particular situations. They help in creating reusable, maintainable, and scalable code.

    Types of Design Patterns:
    
    Design patterns can be broadly categorized into three types:

    1. Creational Patterns: 
        These patterns deal with object creation mechanisms. They aim to create objects in a 
        manner suitable for the situation. Common creational patterns include:
        - Singleton: Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.
        - Factory Method: Defines an interface for creating an object but allows subclasses to alter 
          the type of created objects.
        - Abstract Factory: Provides an interface for creating families of related or dependent 
          objects without specifying their concrete classes.

    2. Structural Patterns: 
        These patterns deal with object composition and typically help in forming large structures 
        by combining objects and classes. Common structural patterns include:
        - Adapter: Allows incompatible interfaces to work together by converting the interface of one 
          class into another that a client expects.
        - Decorator: Adds new functionality to an object without altering its structure by wrapping 
          it with another class.
        - Facade: Provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem, making it easier to use.

    3. Behavioral Patterns: 
        These patterns deal with how objects interact and communicate with each other. Common 
        behavioral patterns include:
        - Observer: Establishes a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object 
          changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.
        - Strategy: Enables selecting an algorithmâ€™s behavior at runtime, encapsulating algorithms 
          so they can be interchangeable.
        - Command: Encapsulates a request as an object, allowing for parameterization of clients 
          with queues, requests, and operations.

    Advantages of Using Design Patterns:
    
    - Reusability: Design patterns provide tested, proven development paradigms that can be 
      reused across different projects. This leads to faster development and fewer bugs.
    - Maintainability: By following design patterns, code is generally more organized and easier 
      to maintain. They promote the use of clear interfaces and contracts, making it easier to 
      understand the system.
    - Scalability: Patterns like the Factory or Singleton enable developers to add new features 
      or scale the system with minimal changes to existing code.
    - Flexibility: Patterns allow for changes in implementation details without altering the 
      clients that use them. This is especially evident in the Strategy and Observer patterns.
    - Communication: Design patterns provide a shared vocabulary for developers. When a pattern 
      is mentioned, it conveys a wealth of information about how the code is structured and what 
      it aims to achieve.
    - Best Practices: Using design patterns often incorporates industry best practices, leading 
      to better architecture and design choices.
