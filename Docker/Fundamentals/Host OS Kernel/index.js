/**
 * Host OS Kernel (Simple Explanation):
 * ------------------------------------
 * - The kernel is like the brain of the operating system. It controls how your computer's hardware
 *   and software work together.
 * - Imagine the kernel as a manager that makes sure everything on your computer runs smoothly,
 *   from apps to devices like your keyboard and printer.
 *
 * - In Docker, all containers share the same "brain" (the host OS kernel). This sharing is what
 *   makes Docker fast and lightweight compared to virtual machines, which each have their own
 *   "brain."
 *
 * Functions of the Host OS Kernel (Layman Terms):
 * -----------------------------------------------
 * 1. **Process Management:**
 *    - Think of the kernel as a traffic cop that directs apps (processes) so they don’t crash
 *      into each other.
 *
 * 2. **Memory Management:**
 *    - The kernel decides how much "desk space" (memory) each app gets so they all fit without
 *      messing up each other's work.
 *
 * 3. **File Management:**
 *    - It organizes and protects your files, making sure only the right apps or users can see or
 *      change them.
 *
 * 4. **Device Management:**
 *    - The kernel is like a translator between your computer and devices like a printer or a USB
 *      drive, helping them understand each other.
 *
 * 5. **Networking:**
 *    - It’s the postman that delivers messages between your computer and others on the internet
 *      or your local network.
 *
 * 6. **Security:**
 *    - The kernel is like a security guard that makes sure apps can’t mess with each other or the
 *      system.
 *
 * Why is the Host OS Kernel Important in Docker? (Layman Terms):
 * --------------------------------------------------------------
 * - In Docker, all containers use the same "brain" (host OS kernel). This is like multiple apps
 *   sharing one phone to make calls. Each app can call whoever it wants without interfering with
 *   others.
 * - This sharing makes containers faster, smaller, and more efficient because they don’t need
 *   their own separate "brain."
 *
 * Practical Analogy:
 * ------------------
 * - Think of the kernel as the manager of a shared office space:
 *    - It makes sure everyone (processes) gets a desk (memory) to work at.
 *    - It handles requests for resources like a printer or internet.
 *    - It ensures no one messes with another person’s work.
 *    - In Docker, containers are like individual workers who all use the same office manager to
 *      get things done.
