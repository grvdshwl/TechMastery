/**
 * Complete Explanation of Kernel and OS Components:
 * --------------------------------------------------
 * The kernel is the core of the operating system, but it works together with other parts of the
 * OS to manage everything on your computer. Below is a breakdown of the kernel, its components,
 * and how it fits into the bigger picture of the OS.
 *
 * ***Parts of the Kernel:***
 * --------------------------
 * 1. **Process Management:**
 *    - Handles starting, running, and stopping programs (also called processes).
 *    - Decides which process gets to use the CPU at any given moment.
 *    - Ensures processes run smoothly without interfering with each other.
 *    - Example: If you're watching a video and downloading a file, the kernel decides how much
 *      CPU time each gets.
 *
 * 2. **Memory Management:**
 *    - Controls how memory (RAM) is shared among programs.
 *    - Makes sure one program doesn’t accidentally use or overwrite another program’s memory.
 *    - Uses techniques like virtual memory to give programs more space than the physical RAM
 *      available.
 *    - Example: If you're running multiple apps, the kernel ensures each app gets its own space
 *      in memory.
 *
 * 3. **Device Management:**
 *    - Acts as a bridge between the OS and hardware devices (e.g., printers, USB drives).
 *    - Uses device drivers to communicate with and control hardware.
 *    - Manages input/output operations, like reading from a hard disk or sending a file to a
 *      printer.
 *    - Example: When you plug in a USB, the kernel loads its driver and makes it accessible.
 *
 * 4. **File System Management:**
 *    - Organizes how data is stored and accessed on disks.
 *    - Provides a structure for files (e.g., folders, directories).
 *    - Ensures data integrity and controls access permissions for files.
 *    - Example: The kernel ensures your documents are saved properly and only accessible by
 *      authorized users.
 *
 * 5. **Networking:**
 *    - Manages communication between your computer and other devices on a network.
 *    - Implements protocols like TCP/IP for sending and receiving data over the internet.
 *    - Example: When you browse a website, the kernel handles the network requests and responses.
 *
 * 6. **Security and Permissions:**
 *    - Enforces access controls, ensuring that users and programs only perform authorized
 *      actions.
 *    - Protects against malicious processes or unauthorized access.
 *    - Example: When you log in, the kernel verifies your credentials and grants appropriate
 *      permissions.
 *
 * ***How the Kernel Fits into the OS:***
 * --------------------------------------
 * The kernel is the "brain" of the OS, but it doesn’t work alone. Other components of the OS rely
 * on the kernel to function:
 *
 * - **Shell:** The user’s interface to the kernel. It takes commands (like opening an app) and
 *   passes them to the kernel.
 * - **System Utilities:** Tools like file managers or task managers that rely on the kernel to
 *   perform their tasks.
 * - **User Interface:** The graphical or command-line interface that lets users interact with the
 *   OS, indirectly using the kernel’s functions.
 *
 * ***Types of Kernels:***
 * ----------------------
 * 1. **Monolithic Kernel:**
 *    - All core services (e.g., process, memory, file system management) run in a single large
 *      process.
 *    - Example: Linux, Unix.
 *    - Advantage: High performance due to fewer layers.
 *    - Disadvantage: A bug in one part of the kernel can crash the whole system.
 *
 * 2. **Microkernel:**
 *    - Only the most essential services run in the kernel, and everything else runs in user space.
 *    - Example: Minix, QNX.
 *    - Advantage: Greater stability and security; a crash in one service doesn’t take down the
 *      whole system.
 *    - Disadvantage: Slower performance due to more communication overhead.
 *
 * 3. **Hybrid Kernel:**
 *    - Combines elements of both monolithic and microkernels.
 *    - Example: Windows NT, macOS.
 *    - Balances performance and stability by running critical services in the kernel and others
 *      in user space.
 *
 * ***Practical Analogy:***
 * ------------------------
 * Think of the kernel as the "engine" of a car:
 * - It powers everything (processes).
 * - It controls how much fuel (memory) each part gets.
 * - It communicates with sensors and hardware (devices).
 * - It ensures the car runs smoothly and securely.
 *
 * Meanwhile, the OS as a whole is like the entire car:
 * - The **shell** is the dashboard where you control the car.
 * - The **file system** is the trunk and glovebox where you store things.
 * - The **networking** is the GPS and communication system.
 *
 * Together, the kernel and other OS components work seamlessly to deliver a functional computer
 * system.
