/**
 * Operating System (OS) vs. Kernel (Technical but Simple Explanation):
 * -------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The **Operating System (OS)** is the software that runs your computer, managing hardware (like CPU,
 * memory, and disks) and software (like apps or services) to make the system usable. The **kernel** is
 * the core part of the OS that directly talks to the hardware. Think of the OS as a full smartphone and
 * the kernel as its processor—the kernel powers the OS, but the OS includes much more. Below, we explain
 * the OS, its components, what it does, and how it differs from the kernel in a technical yet clear way.
 *
 * What is an Operating System (OS)?
 * --------------------------------
 * - The OS is the complete software layer that makes a computer, phone, or server usable. It manages
 *   resources, runs apps, and provides interfaces (e.g., desktop, terminal) for user interaction.
 * - Examples: Linux (e.g., Ubuntu), Windows, macOS, Android.
 * - Key Role: Coordinates hardware (CPU, memory, storage), executes apps, and ensures secure, efficient
 *   operation.
 * - Example: When you open a music app, the OS starts it, allocates memory, and connects to speakers.
 *
 * What Does the OS Do? (Technical but Easy Terms):
 * -----------------------------------------------
 * The OS performs key tasks to make your computer work, relying on the kernel and other components:
 * - **Runs Apps**: Starts and manages apps (processes), scheduling them to use the CPU.
 * - **Manages Hardware**: Uses drivers to let apps talk to hardware like keyboards or GPUs.
 * - **Handles Files**: Organizes data into files and folders with access permissions.
 * - **Enables Multitasking**: Switches between apps (e.g., browser and music player) for smooth operation.
 * - **Manages Networking**: Connects to the internet or devices using protocols like TCP/IP.
 * - **Ensures Security**: Protects with passwords, permissions, and malware defenses.
 *
 * Key Components of an OS (Beyond the Kernel):
 * --------------------------------------------
 * The OS includes various components that work with the kernel to make the system user-friendly and
 * functional:
 *
 * 1. **Kernel**:
 *    - The core module that talks to hardware (CPU, memory, disks) via system calls, managing processes,
 *      memory, and devices.
 *    - Example: Allocates CPU time for a game.
 *
 * 2. **Shell**:
 *    - The user’s gateway to the OS, translating commands into kernel instructions.
 *    - Types: Command-line (e.g., Bash, PowerShell) or graphical (e.g., Windows Explorer, macOS Finder).
 *    - Example: Typing “ls” in a terminal lists files, with the shell passing the request to the kernel.
 *
 * 3. **File System**:
 *    - Organizes and manages data on storage devices (e.g., hard drives, SSDs).
 *    - Examples: NTFS (Windows), ext4 (Linux), APFS (macOS).
 *    - Tracks file locations and controls access permissions.
 *    - Example: Saves a document to your “Downloads” folder with user-only access.
 *
 * 4. **Device Drivers**:
 *    - Software that lets the OS communicate with hardware (e.g., printers, keyboards).
 *    - Acts as a translator between apps and hardware via the kernel.
 *    - Example: A driver lets a photo app use a webcam for video calls.
 *
 * 5. **System Utilities**:
 *    - Tools for system management, like file explorers, task managers, or disk cleanup.
 *    - Example: Windows Task Manager shows CPU usage, relying on the kernel for data.
 *
 * 6. **System Services (Daemons)**:
 *    - Background processes for tasks like scheduling, logging, or running web servers.
 *    - Example: The “cron” daemon in Linux runs scheduled backups, using the kernel to execute tasks.
 *
 * 7. **Bootloader**:
 *    - Starts the OS when the computer powers on, loading the kernel into memory.
 *    - Examples: GRUB (Linux), Windows Boot Manager.
 *    - Example: GRUB lets you choose a Linux version to boot, then starts the kernel.
 *
 * 8. **Inter-Process Communication (IPC)**:
 *    - Mechanisms (e.g., pipes, message queues) that let apps share data or coordinate.
 *    - Example: A music app sends data to a visualizer app via IPC, with the kernel managing the transfer.
 *
 * 9. **System Libraries**:
 *    - Pre-built code (APIs) that apps use for tasks like graphics or networking.
 *    - Simplifies app development by providing standard functions.
 *    - Example: A game uses the OpenGL library to draw images, relying on the kernel for GPU access.
 *
 * How is the OS Different from the Kernel? (Technical but Easy Terms):
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The kernel is a critical part of the OS, but the OS is much broader. Here’s how they differ:
 *
 * 1. **Role and Scope**:
 *    - **Kernel**: The core module that interacts with hardware (CPU, memory, devices) via system calls,
 *      running in privileged “kernel space” to manage low-level tasks.
 *    - **OS**: The full software stack, including the kernel, user interfaces, utilities, and libraries,
 *      providing a complete environment for apps and users.
 *    - Example: The kernel allocates memory for a browser, but the OS provides the browser’s toolbar and
 *      icons.
 *
 * 2. **Functionality**:
 *    - **Kernel**: Handles low-level tasks like process scheduling, memory allocation, and hardware
 *      access. It’s focused and efficient.
 *    - **OS**: Adds user-facing features like graphical desktops, command-line tools, and system
 *      management utilities, built on the kernel.
 *    - Example: The kernel reads a file from disk, but the OS shows it in a file explorer.
 *
 * 3. **User Interaction**:
 *    - **Kernel**: Hidden from users—apps access it via system calls (e.g., “open file” requests).
 *    - **OS**: Provides interfaces (e.g., GUI, terminal) for users to interact with the system.
 *    - Example: You click a file to open it (OS interface), and the kernel reads the data from disk.
 *
 * 4. **Components**:
 *    - **Kernel**: A single, compact module focused on hardware management (e.g., Linux kernel).
 *    - **OS**: Includes the kernel plus shells, file systems, drivers, utilities, daemons, and more.
 *    - Example: The Linux kernel is small, but Ubuntu (an OS) adds a desktop, apps, and tools.
