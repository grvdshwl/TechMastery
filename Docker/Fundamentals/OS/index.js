/**
 * Operating System (OS) (Simple Explanation):
 * -------------------------------------------
 * - The operating system (OS) is like the master controller of your computer. It helps your
 *   computer's hardware (like the keyboard, mouse, and screen) and software (like apps and games)
 *   work together.
 * - Without an OS, your computer would just be a pile of hardware that doesn’t know what to do.
 *
 * What Does the OS Do? (Layman Terms):
 * ------------------------------------
 * 1. **Runs Apps:**
 *    - The OS allows you to open and use apps, like a browser, word processor, or game.
 *    - It makes sure the apps have what they need to run, like memory and processing power.
 *
 * 2. **Manages Hardware:**
 *    - The OS is like a translator between your hardware and your apps.
 *    - For example, when you click a mouse, the OS helps the app understand what you clicked on.
 *
 * 3. **File Storage:**
 *    - The OS organizes your files into folders and helps you save or open them.
 *    - It also ensures that files are stored safely and can’t be accidentally overwritten or
 *      deleted by other programs.
 *
 * 4. **Multitasking:**
 *    - The OS lets you do many things at once, like browsing the internet while listening to
 *      music.
 *    - It switches between tasks so everything works smoothly.
 *
 * 5. **Networking:**
 *    - The OS helps your computer connect to the internet or other devices like printers and
 *      phones.
 *
 * 6. **Security:**
 *    - The OS keeps your computer safe by requiring passwords and controlling what apps and users
 *      can do.
 *
 * Detailed Explanation of OS (Tech Savvy Terms):
 * ----------------------------------------------
 * 1. **Process Management:**
 *    - The OS starts and stops programs, making sure they don’t interfere with each other.
 *    - It handles scheduling so each app gets enough CPU time to run efficiently.
 *
 * 2. **Memory Management:**
 *    - The OS assigns memory to apps and ensures they don’t use more than they need.
 *    - It prevents one app from accessing another app’s memory (isolation).
 *
 * 3. **Device Management:**
 *    - The OS communicates with hardware through drivers, which act like interpreters between the
 *      device and the computer.
 *
 * 4. **File System Management:**
 *    - The OS organizes data into files and folders.
 *    - It controls permissions to ensure that only authorized users or programs can access files.
 *
 * 5. **User Interface:**
 *    - The OS provides a user interface (UI), like a desktop or command line, so you can interact
 *      with the computer.
 *
 * Practical Analogy:
 * ------------------
 * - Think of the OS as the manager of a hotel:
 *    - It assigns rooms (memory) to guests (apps).
 *    - It ensures guests have access to shared resources like the pool (hardware).
 *    - It handles requests like room service (running programs).
 *    - It keeps guests secure by locking their doors (security).
 *
 * Types of Operating Systems:
 * ---------------------------
 * 1. **Desktop OS:**
 *    - Examples: Windows, macOS, Linux.
 *    - Runs on personal computers and provides a graphical user interface (GUI).
 *
 * 2. **Mobile OS:**
 *    - Examples: iOS, Android.
 *    - Designed for smartphones and tablets, optimized for touch screens.
 *
 * 3. **Server OS:**
 *    - Examples: Windows Server, Ubuntu Server, Red Hat Enterprise Linux.
 *    - Designed to manage servers and handle tasks like hosting websites or running databases.
 *
 * 4. **Embedded OS:**
 *    - Examples: FreeRTOS, VxWorks.
 *    - Found in devices like smart TVs, washing machines, and IoT devices.
