/**
 * Difference Between RAM, Processor, and Disk Storage (SSD/HDD):
 * --------------------------------------------------------------
 * RAM, Processor, and Disk Storage are all essential components of a computer, but they serve
 * different purposes and have distinct characteristics. Here's a breakdown:
 *
 * 1. **RAM (Random Access Memory):**
 *    - **Function**: RAM is temporary memory used by the computer to store data that is actively
 *      being used or processed.
 *    - **Speed**: Very fast; RAM can be read from and written to much faster than disk storage
 *      (SSD/HDD).
 *    - **Volatility**: RAM is **volatile**, meaning all data is lost when the computer is turned
 *      off or restarted.
 *    - **Usage**:
 *      - Stores data for running programs and the operating system.
 *      - Allows quick access to the CPU for active tasks.
 *    - Example: If you're running a web browser, the pages, tabs, and data you’re working on
 *      are stored in RAM for fast access.
 *
 * 2. **Processor (CPU - Central Processing Unit):**
 *    - **Function**: The CPU is the "brain" of the computer. It performs calculations, executes
 *      instructions, and manages data between different components.
 *    - **Speed**: The CPU works much faster than RAM and disk storage. However, the CPU doesn't
 *      store data long-term like RAM or disk storage.
 *    - **Usage**:
 *      - Executes instructions and performs tasks for software programs.
 *      - Manages the flow of data to and from RAM, storage, and peripherals.
 *    - Example: When you open an application, the CPU processes the instructions to start the
 *      program and sends data to and from RAM to keep things running.
 *
 * 3. **Disk Storage (SSD or HDD):**
 *    - **Function**: Disk storage is where data is stored permanently (or long-term). This is
 *      where your operating system, applications, and personal files are kept.
 *    - **Types**:
 *      - **SSD (Solid State Drive)**: Faster, uses flash memory, no moving parts.
 *      - **HDD (Hard Disk Drive)**: Slower, uses spinning disks and a mechanical arm to read/write.
 *    - **Speed**:
 *      - **SSD**: Much faster than HDDs, but still slower than RAM.
 *      - **HDD**: Slower compared to both SSDs and RAM.
 *    - **Volatility**: Disk storage is **non-volatile**, meaning the data stays saved even when
 *      the computer is turned off.
 *    - **Usage**:
 *      - Stores the operating system, software, files, and other permanent data.
 *    - Example: When you save a document, it gets stored on the disk (SSD or HDD), and when
 *      you restart your computer, the data remains intact.
 *
 * ***Key Differences:***
 * ---------------------
 * 1. **Purpose**:
 *    - **RAM**: Temporary storage for active data and tasks.
 *    - **Processor**: Executes instructions and performs tasks.
 *    - **Disk Storage (SSD/HDD)**: Long-term storage for files and software.
 *
 * 2. **Speed**:
 *    - **RAM**: Extremely fast; provides quick access to data for the CPU.
 *    - **Processor**: Even faster than RAM for executing instructions.
 *    - **Disk Storage (SSD/HDD)**: SSDs are faster than HDDs, but both are much slower than
 *      RAM and the CPU.
 *
 * 3. **Volatility**:
 *    - **RAM**: Volatile (data is lost when the power is off).
 *    - **Processor**: Non-volatile in the sense that it continues working as long as the system
 *      is on.
 *    - **Disk Storage**: Non-volatile (data is saved even when powered off).
 *
 * 4. **Size and Cost**:
 *    - **RAM**: Generally smaller in size (GBs) and more expensive per GB than disk storage.
 *    - **Processor**: Fixed component with a fixed price based on performance.
 *    - **Disk Storage**: Larger in size (TBs) and cheaper per GB compared to RAM.
 *
 * 5. **Role in the System**:
 *    - **RAM**: Supports the CPU by providing fast access to the active data and instructions.
 *    - **Processor**: Directs the flow of data and executes instructions.
 *    - **Disk Storage**: Stores data for long-term use, like your operating system, files, and
 *      programs.
 *
 * ***Practical Analogy:***
 * ------------------------
 * - **RAM**: Think of RAM as a desk where you lay out all the documents you’re actively working
 *   on. It’s fast to access, but once you leave, everything gets cleared off the desk.
 * - **Processor (CPU)**: The CPU is like the person working at the desk, processing the data
 *   and instructions, making decisions, and executing tasks.
 * - **Disk Storage (SSD/HDD)**: The disk storage is like a filing cabinet where you store your
 *   documents for later use. It’s slower to access, but the data stays safe even when you leave.
