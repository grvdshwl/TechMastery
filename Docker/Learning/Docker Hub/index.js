/**
 * Docker Hub:
 * ------------
 * Docker Hub is a cloud-based service provided by Docker for sharing and managing Docker
 * container images. It acts as a central repository where users can store, share, and access
 * Docker images, which are the building blocks for creating containers.
 *
 * Key Features:
 * -------------
 * 1. **Public and Private Repositories**:
 *    - **Public repositories** are available to everyone, meaning anyone can pull (download)
 *      the images for use.
 *    - **Private repositories** are accessible only to authorized users, providing a secure
 *      space to store images for your organization or personal use.
 *
 * 2. **Docker Images**:
 *    - Docker Hub hosts **Docker images**, which are the packaged versions of applications,
 *      tools, or environments, ready to run in Docker containers.
 *    - These images can be downloaded to your local machine to create containers or uploaded
 *      to share with others.
 *    - Popular images include base operating systems (e.g., Ubuntu, Alpine), databases (e.g.,
 *      MySQL, PostgreSQL), web servers (e.g., Nginx), and more.
 *
 * 3. **Automated Builds**:
 *    - Docker Hub supports **automated builds**, meaning you can configure your repository to
 *      automatically build Docker images from source code stored in GitHub or Bitbucket.
 *    - This allows you to automate the process of creating up-to-date container images whenever
 *      the source code changes.
 *
 * 4. **Docker Hub CLI and API**:
 *    - Users can interact with Docker Hub via the **CLI (Command Line Interface)** by using
 *      the `docker` command, like `docker pull` to download images or `docker push` to upload
 *      images.
 *    - Thereâ€™s also a **REST API** for programmatically accessing and managing images and
 *      repositories.
 *
 * 5. **Official Images**:
 *    - Docker Hub contains **official images** from popular software vendors, which are high-quality,
 *      well-maintained images optimized for production use.
 *    - Examples include images for MySQL, Nginx, Redis, and more.
 *
 * 6. **Docker Hub for Collaboration**:
 *    - Docker Hub allows teams to collaborate by creating shared repositories, making it easier to
 *      maintain and distribute images within a group.
 *
 * 7. **Docker Hub Free and Paid Plans**:
 *    - Docker Hub offers both free and paid plans. The free plan has limitations on the number of
 *      private repositories, while the paid plans offer more features like increased private repo
 *      storage and team collaboration tools.
 *
 * ***Key Operations with Docker Hub:***
 * -------------------------------------
 * 1. **Pulling Images**:
 *    - You can pull Docker images from Docker Hub using the command `docker pull <image_name>`.
 *      This downloads an image to your local machine for use.
 *
 * 2. **Pushing Images**:
 *    - After creating a Docker image, you can push it to Docker Hub using `docker push <image_name>`.
 *      This uploads your image to a repository on Docker Hub for others to access.
 *
 * 3. **Creating Repositories**:
 *    - Users can create repositories to store their images. A repository can hold multiple versions
 *      of the same image, which are differentiated by tags (e.g., `myimage:v1`, `myimage:v2`).
 *
 * ***Practical Analogy:***
 * ------------------------
 * Think of Docker Hub as a library:
 * - **Public Repositories**: Like public books that anyone can borrow and use.
 * - **Private Repositories**: Like private collections of books that only authorized people can
 *   borrow.
 * - **Images**: Like the books in the library, where each book (image) has specific content
 *   (programs or environments) you need.
 * - **Pulling**: Borrowing a book from the library to use.
 * - **Pushing**: Donating your own books (images) to the library for others to use.
