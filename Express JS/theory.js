    Top 10 Important Theoretical Questions for Express.js:

    1. **What is Express.js?**
       - Express.js is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features to develop web and mobile applications. It simplifies routing, middleware, and handling HTTP requests.

    2. **What is Middleware in Express.js?**
       - Middleware functions are functions that have access to the request object (req), the response object (res), and the next function in the application’s request-response cycle. They can modify the request, the response, or terminate the request-response cycle.

    3. **What are the different types of Middleware in Express.js?**
       - Types of middleware in Express.js include:
         - **Application-level middleware**: Bound to an instance of the app object.
         - **Router-level middleware**: Bound to an instance of express.Router().
         - **Error-handling middleware**: Specifically designed to handle errors.
         - **Built-in middleware**: Provided by Express (e.g., express.json(), express.static()).
         - **Third-party middleware**: External libraries (e.g., morgan, body-parser).

    4. **What is Routing in Express.js?**
       - Routing refers to how an application’s endpoints (URIs) respond to client requests. Express allows you to define route handlers for different HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) on specific routes.

    5. **How can you handle HTTP request methods in Express.js?**
       - In Express.js, HTTP methods such as GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, and PATCH can be handled using corresponding methods like `app.get()`, `app.post()`, `app.put()`, `app.delete()`, and `app.patch()`.

    6. **What is a Template Engine in Express.js?**
       - A template engine allows you to generate HTML pages dynamically by embedding JavaScript into an HTML template. Express.js supports various template engines like EJS, Pug, and Handlebars.

    7. **What is Error Handling in Express.js?**
       - Express.js allows you to handle errors with error-handling middleware. This middleware takes four arguments (`err`, `req`, `res`, `next`) and is used to catch errors that occur in the request-response cycle.

    8. **What is the purpose of the `next()` function in Express.js?**
       - The `next()` function is used to pass control to the next middleware function. If there is no error, `next()` is called, allowing the next middleware in line to handle the request. If an error occurs, it is passed to error-handling middleware.

    9. **How do you serve static files in Express.js?**
       - Static files (e.g., images, CSS, JavaScript) can be served in Express.js using the built-in middleware function `express.static()`. You can specify a folder to serve static files from.

    10. **What are the benefits of using Express.js?**
        - Some of the benefits of Express.js include:
          - Minimal and flexible framework for building web applications.
          - Middleware support for additional functionalities (authentication, logging, etc.).
          - Simplified routing and error handling.
          - Large number of built-in utilities (e.g., URL encoding, body parsing).
          - Robust community and rich ecosystem of plugins and tools.
