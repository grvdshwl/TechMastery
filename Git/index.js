// Q: If we have three branches (`dev`, `qa`, and `main`) that are initially synchronized,
// and we remove the last two commits from `main`, then create a pull request (PR) from `main` to `qa`,
// will this PR affect `qa`?

// A: No, this PR will not affect `qa`. Since `qa` is already ahead of `main` by the two commits that were removed,
// Git will detect no new changes to merge, resulting in an empty PR. Merging this PR will have no impact on `qa`,
// as it already contains the commits removed from `main`.
