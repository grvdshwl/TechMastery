/**
 * üìö Introduction to GraphQL
 * GraphQL is a query language for your API, and a runtime for executing those queries
 * by using a type system you define for your data. It allows clients to request only
 * the data they need, and nothing more, ensuring efficiency and flexibility.
 *
 * üöÄ Key Concepts:
 * - **Schema**: Defines the structure of the data, including types, queries, mutations,
 *   and subscriptions.
 * - **Query**: A read operation to fetch data.
 * - **Mutation**: A write operation to modify data.
 * - **Resolver**: A function that resolves a query or mutation, connecting the schema
 *   with your data source.
 * - **Types**: Strongly-typed system defining the shape of data (e.g., `String`, `Int`,
 *   `Boolean`, custom objects, etc.).

/**
 * ‚úÖ Pros of GraphQL:
 * 1. **Efficient Data Fetching**:
 *    - Clients can request exactly the data they need, avoiding over-fetching or under-fetching.
 * 2. **Single Endpoint**:
 *    - Unlike REST, which typically has multiple endpoints, GraphQL uses a single endpoint
 *      for all operations.
 * 3. **Real-Time Updates**:
 *    - Supports subscriptions for real-time communication.
 * 4. **Strong Typing**:
 *    - Ensures the API is self-documenting and predictable through a defined schema.
 * 5. **Flexible Queries**:
 *    - Clients have complete control over what they fetch, promoting versatility.
 */

/**
 * ‚ùå Cons of GraphQL:
 * 1. **Complexity**:
 *    - Setting up and maintaining a GraphQL server can be more complex than REST.
 * 2. **Overhead**:
 *    - While clients can request specific data, poorly designed queries can result in
 *      complex resolutions and higher server load.
 * 3. **Caching Challenges**:
 *    - Unlike REST, where caching is straightforward (e.g., through URLs), GraphQL
 *      requires more sophisticated approaches.
 * 4. **Learning Curve**:
 *    - Developers need to understand its query language, schema design, and resolvers.
 * 5. **Security Concerns**:
 *    - Exposing too much data can make APIs vulnerable if queries are not controlled properly.
 * 6. **Versioning**:
 *    - GraphQL does not have built-in versioning like REST (e.g., `/v1/users`). Instead,
 *      you manage changes by evolving the schema, which can make backward compatibility
 *      more complex to maintain.
