/**
 * 🔧 Example: A Simple GraphQL Query
 * Imagine we want to fetch user data, including their name and a list of their posts.
 */

// Example GraphQL Query:
const query = `
  query {
    user(id: "123") {
      name
      posts {
        title
        content
      }
    }
  }
`;

/**
 * In this query:
 * - We request a `user` with a specific `id`.
 * - Only the `name` and their `posts` (with `title` and `content`) are returned.
 */

/**
 * ⚙️ How Does It Work?
 * 1. **Client Sends Query**: A client sends a query to the GraphQL endpoint.
 * 2. **Server Parses Query**: The server parses the query and matches it against
 *    the schema.
 * 3. **Resolver Functions Execute**: Each field in the query is resolved by a
 *    resolver function.
 * 4. **Response Returned**: The server returns the requested data in a JSON format.
 */

/**
 * 🌟 When to Use GraphQL?
 * - Applications with complex data relationships.
 * - Scenarios where flexibility in querying is essential.
 * - Real-time applications requiring subscriptions.
 * - Frontend-driven development where UI demands specific data structures.
 */

/**
 * 🌐 Alternatives:
 * If GraphQL doesn't fit your use case, consider:
 * - **REST APIs**: Simpler and effective for many applications.
 * - **gRPC**: High-performance, language-neutral, and platform-neutral remote procedure calls.
 * - **Falcor**: Data-fetching library by Netflix, similar to GraphQL.
