// Concept of Refresh Token and Access Token

// 1. Access Token:
// - An access token is a credential used to access protected resources on behalf of a user.
// - It is typically a short-lived token, meaning it has a limited lifespan (e.g., 15 minutes to 1 hour).
// - Access tokens are issued by an authentication server upon successful login and are included in the request headers when making API calls.
// - Since access tokens are short-lived, they help minimize security risks associated with token theft.

// Example of how an access token is used in an API request:
fetch("https://api.example.com/protected-resource", {
  method: "GET",
  headers: {
    Authorization: `Bearer ${accessToken}`, // Attach access token in Authorization header
  },
});

// 2. Refresh Token:
// - A refresh token is a credential used to obtain a new access token without requiring the user to log in again.
// - Refresh tokens are typically long-lived and can last for weeks or months.
// - They are stored securely and are used to request a new access token when the original access token expires.
// - This mechanism allows for better user experience, as users do not have to re-enter their credentials frequently.

// Example of how a refresh token is used to obtain a new access token:
fetch("https://api.example.com/token/refresh", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    refreshToken: storedRefreshToken, // Send the stored refresh token
  }),
})
  .then((response) => response.json())
  .then((data) => {
    const newAccessToken = data.accessToken; // Use the new access token
  });

// 3. Flow of Access and Refresh Tokens:
// - User logs in and receives both an access token and a refresh token.
// - User uses the access token to make requests to protected resources.
// - When the access token expires, the application can use the refresh token to request a new access token.
// - The server validates the refresh token and issues a new access token if valid.

// 4. Security Considerations:
// - Access tokens should be stored securely and transmitted over HTTPS to prevent interception.
// - Refresh tokens should also be securely stored, as they allow obtaining new access tokens.
// - Implementing rotation strategies for refresh tokens can enhance security by invalidating the previous refresh token when a new one is issued.

// Conclusion:
// The use of access and refresh tokens helps in maintaining user sessions securely while minimizing the need for repeated logins.
// Understanding their roles and implementation can significantly enhance the security and usability of authentication mechanisms in applications.
