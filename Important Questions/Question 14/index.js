// Using the React Profiler to Identify Performance Bottlenecks

// The React Profiler is a built-in tool that helps developers analyze the performance
// of their React applications. It provides insights into component rendering behavior,
// allowing you to identify unnecessary renders and optimize your application.

// Steps to Use the React Profiler:

// 1. Integrate the Profiler:
import { Profiler } from "react";

const MyComponent = () => {
  const handleRender = (
    id,
    phase,
    actualDuration,
    baseDuration,
    startTime,
    commitTime
  ) => {
    console.log({
      id,
      phase,
      actualDuration,
      baseDuration,
      startTime,
      commitTime,
    });
  };

  return (
    <Profiler id="MyComponent" onRender={handleRender}>
      <ChildComponent />
    </Profiler>
  );
};

// 2. Analyze Profiler Output:
// After running your application, inspect the console logs or the Profiler tab in React DevTools.
// Look for components that have high actualDuration times or are rendering more frequently than expected.
// Pay attention to the baseDuration, as it indicates how long a component takes to render without any interruptions.

// 3. Identify Unnecessary Renders:
// Focus on components that re-render frequently, which might indicate that their props or state are changing more often than necessary.
// Check for components with the phase labeled as "update," suggesting they are re-rendering when they shouldn't be.

// Steps to Fix Performance Bottlenecks:

// 1. Memoization:
// Use React.memo to memoize functional components, preventing unnecessary re-renders when props remain unchanged.
const MemoizedComponent = React.memo(MyComponent);

// 2. Use of useMemo and useCallback:
// Apply useMemo for expensive calculations and useCallback for functions that are passed as props to prevent them from being recreated on every render.
const memoizedValue = useMemo(() => computeExpensiveValue(a, b), [a, b]);
const memoizedCallback = useCallback(() => {
  /* callback logic */
}, [dependencies]);

// 3. Avoid Inline Functions in JSX:
// Define functions outside the render method or use useCallback to prevent creating new function instances on every render.

// 4. Proper State Management:
// Ensure that state updates are granular and only affect components that need to be re-rendered.
// Consider using separate state slices for different parts of your application to minimize re-renders.

// 5. Analyze Context Usage:
// If you're using the Context API, ensure that only components that need to re-render based on context changes are subscribed to the context.
// Consider splitting contexts if necessary to reduce the number of re-renders across unrelated components.

// 6. Batch State Updates:
// If you're updating state multiple times in a single event handler, make sure to batch these updates where possible to reduce renders.

// Conclusion:
// By effectively using the React Profiler to analyze component rendering behavior and implementing optimization strategies, you can significantly improve the performance of your React applications and reduce unnecessary renders.
