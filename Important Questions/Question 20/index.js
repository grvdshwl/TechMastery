  Transpiler vs Bundler

  A **transpiler** is a tool that converts source code written in one programming language 
  or version to another. Its primary use case in web development is to convert modern 
  JavaScript (ES6 and beyond) into a version compatible with older browsers (e.g., ES5). 
  Key features include:
  
  - Syntax transformation: Changes newer syntax to older syntax (e.g., converting arrow 
    functions to regular functions).
  - Feature conversion: Replaces newer features not supported in older environments with 
    equivalent constructs.

  Examples of Transpilers:
  - Babel: The most widely used transpiler for JavaScript, allowing modern JavaScript 
    development while ensuring compatibility with older browsers.
  - TypeScript: Transpiles TypeScript (a superset of JavaScript with type definitions) to 
    plain JavaScript.

  
  A **bundler** is a tool that takes multiple files (such as JavaScript, CSS, and images) 
  and combines them into a single file (or a few files) for distribution. This process 
  is essential for optimizing web applications, as it helps reduce the number of HTTP 
  requests and improves loading times. Bundlers can also manage dependencies, allowing 
  developers to use modules without worrying about their loading order.

  Examples of Bundlers:
  - Webpack: A powerful bundler that allows for various configurations and supports loaders 
    to preprocess files (like transpiling with Babel).
  - Rollup: A bundler optimized for libraries, focusing on ES modules and tree-shaking.
  - Parcel: A zero-configuration bundler that automatically handles many tasks behind the 
    scenes.


  Summary of Differences:
  - Purpose: Transpilers convert code to ensure compatibility across environments, while 
    bundlers combine multiple files into a single output for efficient loading.
  - Functionality: Transpilers primarily focus on code syntax and features, whereas 
    bundlers manage file organization, dependencies, and production optimization.

  In many modern development setups, both tools are used together: a transpiler processes 
  the code, and then a bundler packages it for deployment.
