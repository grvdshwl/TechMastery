Image Processing and Optimization in Frontend:

1. Image Formats:
   - Choose appropriate image formats like JPEG, PNG, SVG, or WebP based on content and browser support.
   - JPEG for photographs, PNG for images with transparency, SVG for vector graphics, and WebP for modern browsers.

2. Compression Techniques:
   - Use compression tools to reduce image file sizes without significant loss in quality.
   - Tools like ImageOptim, TinyPNG, or plugins like imagemin for build processes can help in compression.

3. Responsive Images:
   - Implement responsive images using srcset and sizes attributes to serve different image sizes based on device resolutions.
   - Use CSS media queries to adjust image sizes for different viewport sizes.

4. Lazy Loading:
   - Implement lazy loading to defer loading off-screen images until they are needed.
   - This improves initial page load times and reduces the overall bandwidth usage.

5. Image CDN (Content Delivery Network):
   - Utilize image CDNs to serve images from servers located closer to users, reducing latency and improving load times.

6. Optimizing Image Loading:
   - Consider using techniques like progressive image loading or inline image previews to provide a better user experience.

7. Minification:
   - Minify HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files to reduce page load times, including any inline images or data URIs.
