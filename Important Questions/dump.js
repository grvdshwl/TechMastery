// 1. Implement useAsyncStorage Hook to create a custom React Hook for persistent state management:

// const [value, setValue] = useAsyncStorage(key, initialVal);

// This hook provides [value, setValue] to manage the state and persist data using async storage with the specified key and initialVal.

// 2. Implement a retry function for API calls that returns a Promise and retries the API call within a defined limit until it succeeds.

// 3. Implement a memoization function that caches values based on arguments, with each cached entry having an expiration time to ensure only relevant values are retained.

// 4. Discuss projects in-depth, focusing on technical challenges, architecture, and optimizations applied during development.

// 5. Describe essential props for optimizing FlatList in React Native, such as keyExtractor, getItemLayout, initialNumToRender, and windowSize, along with other methods to enhance list rendering efficiency.

// 6. Discuss the differences between old and new React Native architectures, focusing on improvements in performance, native module handling, and JavaScript-to-native bridge communication.
