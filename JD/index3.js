// Here is my interview experience for Google and some useful resources and tips while preparing for it.

// Here's a recap, including all the topics we discussed:

// How to Prepare:

// 1. Resume: Craft a concise and impactful resume, ideally fitting it on one page.
// 2. Problem-Solving: Sharpen your problem-solving skills by practicing 3-4 Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) questions daily. Utilize resources like takeUforward for targeted practice.
// 3. Difficulty Level: Concentrate on solving medium to hard-level coding questions.
// 4. Googleyness Rounds: Prepare for behavioral and situational questions by practicing and framing stories from your past experiences.
// 5. Mock Interviews: Conduct mock interviews with friends to simulate the real interview setting.

// My Interview Experience:

// I had five technical rounds and one Googleyness round. The first was a phone screen with a medium-difficulty array question. Then, I had four online interviews over two days, two interviews per day. These rounds featured challenging questions on graphs, trees, and binary search, often at a hard difficulty level. After two weeks, I had a Team Matching round, and finally, I received the offer letter two weeks later!

// Tips:

// 1. Resume: Include all relevant tech stacks used in your projects and highlight the impact of your work.
// 2. Problem-Solving: Continuously boost your problem-solving abilities.
// 3. Communication: Be vocal about your thought process during interviews.
// 4. Seeking Hints: If stuck, don't hesitate to ask for hints from the interviewer.
// 5. Edge Cases: Cover all edge cases and dry-run your code with sample inputs.
// 6. Code Quality: Write well-structured and readable code.
