//* Language Features:

// - Closures: Functions retain access to their lexical scope.
// - Prototypes and Prototypal Inheritance: Objects inherit properties and methods.
// - Asynchronous JavaScript: Handling async operations with Promises, async/await, and callbacks.
// - Generators: Functions that can pause and resume their execution.
// - ES6+ Features: Destructuring, arrow functions, spread/rest operators, classes, modules, etc.

//* Functional Programming:

// - Higher-Order Functions: Functions accepting or returning other functions.
// - Immutability: Working with immutable data structures to avoid mutation.
// - Currying and Partial Application: Transforming functions into sequences of functions.

//* Design Patterns:

// - Module Pattern: Organizing code into reusable modules.
// - Observer Pattern: Maintaining a list of observers for state change notifications.
// - Singleton Pattern: Ensuring a class has only one instance with global access.

//* Performance Optimization:

// - Memoization: Caching function call results for performance enhancement.
// - Debouncing and Throttling: Controlling function execution rates.
// - Optimizing DOM Manipulation: Strategies for efficient DOM handling.

//* Advanced Web Concepts:

// - Service Workers: Enabling offline functionality, push notifications, etc.
// - WebSockets and Real-Time Communication: Bidirectional client-server communication.
// - Web Workers: Multithreading in the browser for background script execution.

//* Security:

// - Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): Preventing injection of malicious scripts.
// - Content Security Policy (CSP): Managing loaded resources to prevent XSS attacks.

//* Testing and Debugging:

// - Unit Testing: Writing tests using frameworks like Jest, Mocha, Jasmine, etc.
// - Debugging Techniques: Advanced debugging with browser developer tools, breakpoints, code stepping, etc.
