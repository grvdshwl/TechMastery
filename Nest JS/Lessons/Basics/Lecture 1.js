/*
  NestJS is a framework for building scalable and efficient server-side applications. It is built on top of Node.js and leverages TypeScript. It uses Express (or Fastify) under the hood to provide a powerful platform for creating REST APIs, microservices, and real-time applications.

  Uses:
  - Building backend applications and APIs
  - Developing microservices and server-side applications
  - Real-time apps with WebSockets or GraphQL
  - Building modular, maintainable, and scalable applications
  - It works great with TypeScript, ensuring type safety and better developer experience.

  Pros:
  - **Modular architecture**: Encourages a modular approach to organizing code, making it scalable and maintainable.
  - **TypeScript by default**: Full support for TypeScript, which enables better development experience, static typing, and tooling support.
  - **Extensive ecosystem**: A rich ecosystem with libraries and integrations for database ORM (TypeORM, Sequelize), authentication, caching, logging, etc.
  - **Easy testing**: Integrated testing utilities to make unit testing and integration testing easier.
  - **Support for microservices**: Built-in support for creating microservices using various transport layers (TCP, WebSockets, Kafka, etc.).
  - **High productivity**: With decorators, dependency injection, and out-of-the-box configuration, development is faster and more structured.

  Cons:
  - **Learning curve**: Can be challenging for developers new to TypeScript or the NestJS ecosystem due to its complex architecture and concepts like decorators and dependency injection.
  - **Overhead**: While it's powerful, the abstraction can introduce overhead in terms of performance and complexity compared to simple Express apps.
  - **Not as widely adopted**: Though growing, NestJS is not as widely used as Express, meaning fewer resources and examples might be available for troubleshooting.
  - **Requires TypeScript knowledge**: While this is an advantage for many, developers not familiar with TypeScript might find it difficult to jump in.

  Overall, NestJS is a great choice for developers who want to build highly scalable, maintainable, and testable backend applications, particularly those using TypeScript.
