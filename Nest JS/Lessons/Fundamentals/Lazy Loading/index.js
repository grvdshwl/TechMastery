/**
 * Lazy-Loading Modules in NestJS
 *
 * Lazy-loading modules is a strategy to load specific modules only when needed,
 * rather than during application bootstrap. It is particularly useful for improving
 * performance and resource efficiency in certain scenarios.
 *
 * Key Scenarios for Using Lazy-Loading Modules:
 *
 * 1. Serverless Applications
 *    - **Why**: Minimizes cold start times in serverless environments.
 *    - **Example**: Dynamically load a module for handling specific webhooks or API endpoints.
 *
 * 2. Resource-Intensive Modules
 *    - **Why**: Defers loading heavy dependencies or computationally expensive services.
 *    - **Example**: Modules handling large datasets or third-party APIs.
 *
 * 3. Conditional Module Usage
 *    - **Why**: Trigger specific services or logic based on dynamic input.
 *    - **Example**: Processing specific requests based on user-provided parameters.
 *
 * 4. Microservices and Event-Driven Systems
 *    - **Why**: Optimize resource usage by loading modules only when certain events occur.
 *    - **Example**: Dynamically load modules for specific event types.
 *
 * 5. Deferred Initialization
 *    - **Why**: Speed up application bootstrap for subsequent requests by asynchronously
 *      loading additional modules after startup.
 *    - **Example**: Register non-critical modules post-application startup.

/**
 * How to Implement Lazy-Loading
 *
 * 1. Inject the LazyModuleLoader
 *    ```typescript
 *    import { LazyModuleLoader } from '@nestjs/core';
 *
 *    @Injectable()
 *    export class AppService {
 *      constructor(private lazyModuleLoader: LazyModuleLoader) {}
 *    }
 *    ```
 *
 * 2. Load a Module Dynamically
 *    ```typescript
 *    const { LazyModule } = await import('./lazy.module');
 *    const moduleRef = await this.lazyModuleLoader.load(() => LazyModule);
 *    ```
 *
 * 3. Retrieve Providers Dynamically
 *    ```typescript
 *    const { LazyService } = await import('./lazy.service');
 *    const lazyService = moduleRef.get(LazyService);
 *    ```

/**
 * Limitations and Considerations
 *
 * 1. Lifecycle Hooks:
 *    - Lifecycle hooks like `OnModuleInit` or `OnApplicationBootstrap` are not invoked
 *      in lazy-loaded modules.
 *
 * 2. Controllers, Resolvers, and Middleware:
 *    - Controllers and resolvers cannot be lazy-loaded due to route registration requirements.
 *    - Middleware functions cannot be registered dynamically.
 *
 * 3. Global Modules:
 *    - Lazy-loaded modules cannot be registered as global modules.
 *
 * 4. Transport Strategies:
 *    - Some transport strategies (e.g., Kafka, RabbitMQ, or gRPC) require subscriptions
 *      at startup, making lazy-loading incompatible.
 *
 * 5. GraphQL Code-First Approach:
 *    - GraphQL schemas require all resolvers and metadata to be available at bootstrap,
 *      making lazy-loading impractical.
 */

/**
 * Common Use Cases
 *
 * 1. Serverless Functions:
 *    - Trigger different modules for specific lambda invocations or webhooks.
 *    - Optimize startup time by loading only relevant modules.
 *
 * 2. Cron Jobs/Workers:
 *    - Dynamically load modules based on the job type or input data.
 *
 * 3. Feature-Specific Logic:
 *    - Load rarely used features or admin tools on-demand.
 *
 * 4. Route-Based Dynamic Modules:
 *    - Use query parameters, paths, or user roles to determine which module to load.
 */

/**
 * Summary:
 * Lazy-loading modules improves performance and resource utilization, especially
 * in serverless, event-driven, or conditional-use scenarios. However, it has limitations
 * such as lifecycle hooks and controller registration, so its application should
 * be carefully considered based on project requirements.
