// ===============================
// Introduction
// ===============================

// Nest (NestJS) is a powerful framework for building efficient, scalable server-side applications in Node.js.
// It utilizes progressive JavaScript, fully supports TypeScript,
// and still allows developers to code in pure JavaScript when necessary.
// Nest combines Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), Functional Programming (FP),
// and Functional Reactive Programming (FRP) to provide a rich, flexible development experience.

// ===============================
// Key Features
// ===============================

// Under the hood, Nest leverages robust HTTP server frameworks like Express (the default)
// and can optionally be configured to use Fastify, providing greater performance and scalability.

// Nest abstracts the complexity of these Node.js frameworks (Express/Fastify),
// while exposing their APIs directly to developers. This allows developers
// to take advantage of the extensive ecosystem of third-party modules available for the platform.

// ===============================
// Philosophy
// ===============================

// Over recent years, JavaScript has evolved into the universal language for both frontend and backend development
// thanks to the power of Node.js. This evolution has sparked remarkable projects like Angular, React, and Vue,
// which have greatly enhanced productivity, performance, and extensibility in frontend development.

// However, despite the plethora of libraries and tools available for Node.js, there has been one major challenge: architecture.
// Many tools solve specific problems but fail to offer a coherent architectural solution for large-scale applications.

// Nest addresses this challenge by providing a modular, out-of-the-box application architecture.
// This architecture allows developers to create highly testable, scalable, loosely-coupled,
// and maintainable applications. It is heavily inspired by Angular, ensuring consistency and robustness in your project structure.

// ===============================
// Installation
// ===============================

// To get started, you can either scaffold a new project using the Nest CLI or clone a starter project.
// Both approaches will yield the same result.

// $ npm i -g @nestjs/cli
// $ nest new project-name

// ===============================
// Hint for Stricter TypeScript Setup
// ===============================

// To create a new TypeScript project with stricter TypeScript features,
// pass the --strict flag when running the nest new command.
