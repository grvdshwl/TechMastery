//* Using Web Workers in React.js

// Web workers are JavaScript scripts that execute in a separate thread
// from the main browser thread. This enables them to run independently,
// without causing blocking on the main thread. They are particularly
// beneficial for CPU-intensive tasks or operations that require significant time.

//* Understanding Web Workers' Mechanism
// Web workers utilize a messaging system for communication with the main thread.
// Messages can be sent from the main thread to request tasks from the worker,
// and the worker can respond by sending messages back to report task results.

//* Advantages
// - Improved Performance: By delegating resource-heavy tasks to web workers,
//   the main thread remains unblocked, resulting in a more responsive user interface.
// - Parallel Processing: Web workers allow for concurrent task execution,
//   optimizing performance, especially on multi-core processors.

//* Limitations
// - No Direct DOM Access: Web workers lack direct access to the DOM,
//   limiting their utility primarily to computational and data processing tasks.
// - Cross-Origin Restrictions: Web workers are constrained by cross-origin policies.
//   Shared Workers can serve as a workaround to this limitation within the same origin.
