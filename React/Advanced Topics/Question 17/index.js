//* Protect your react application for xss attacks
// 1. Sanitize user inputs by using libraries like DOMPurify.
// 2. Use React's dangerouslySetInnerHTML cautiously, ensuring input is sanitized.
// 3. Implement Content Security Policy (CSP) headers to restrict resource loading.
// 4. Escape user-generated content when rendering to prevent script injection.
// 5. Regularly update dependencies to patch security vulnerabilities.

//* Improve performance for complex animation in react
// 1. Use CSS animations or transitions instead of JavaScript animations.
// 2. Utilize React's shouldComponentUpdate or PureComponent to minimize unnecessary re-renders.
// 3. Employ requestAnimationFrame for smoother animations and better performance.
// 4. Implement lazy loading for components and assets to reduce initial load time.
// 5. Optimize component rendering by avoiding unnecessary state updates and DOM manipulations.

//* How to prevent unnecessary rerenders in react
// 1. Memoize expensive computations using React's useMemo or useCallback hooks.
// 2. Use PureComponent or React.memo to prevent re-renders of components unless props change.
// 3. Ensure that objects passed as props to components are not recreated on each render.
// 4. Implement shouldComponentUpdate lifecycle method to customize component update conditions.
// 5. Split large components into smaller ones to isolate re-renders to specific sections.

//* How will you use git with team members for better management
// 1. Establish clear branching strategies such as GitFlow or feature branches for collaborative development.
// 2. Utilize pull requests for code review and integration of changes into the main branch.
// 3. Maintain descriptive commit messages and follow a consistent commit convention.
// 4. Regularly merge and rebase branches to keep the codebase clean and up-to-date.
// 5. Utilize issue tracking systems like GitHub Issues or Jira to coordinate tasks and track progress.

//* How React.js works with ARIA
// 1. Use ARIA attributes like role, aria-label, aria-labelledby to improve accessibility.
// 2. Ensure proper semantics and keyboard navigation for interactive elements using ARIA.
// 3. Leverage React's support for ARIA attributes to dynamically update accessibility properties based on component state.
// 4. Test accessibility features using tools like axe-core or React's built-in accessibility checker.
// 5. Document ARIA usage in component libraries for developers and designers to maintain consistency.
