//*Jest

// Jest is a javascript testing library

//Jest is test runner that finds the test ,runs the test and determines if test is passed
//  or failed and reports it in a human readable manner

//* React Testing Library

// It is javascript testing utility that provides virtual dom for testing React components.

// React Testing library is family of packages that helps in testing UI components.

// Core Testing library is DOM Testing library and RTL is a wrapper around it to test
//  react application efficiently

//* Types of Test

//* Unit Test

// Focus on testing individual blocks of apllication such as class or functions
//each unit is tested individually,independent of other units.

//* Integration test

// Focus on testing combination of units and ensure that units works together.

//* End to end Test

//Focus on Testing entire application flow and ensuring that it works
//  as designed from start to finish.

//Involves Real UI, Real backend  and real services.

//* Test Driven Development

// Test driven development is a software development process where you write tests before
// writing the software code

// Once the tests have been written, you then write the code to ensure the tests pass

// 1. Create tests that verify the functionality of a specific feature
// 2. Write software code that will run the tests successfully when re-executed
// 3. Refactor the code for optimization while ensuring the tests continue to pass

// Also called red-green testing as all tests go from a red failed state to a green passed state

// It is a software develpment process where you write the test before writing the software code.

//* Jest Watch Mode

// Watch mode is an option that we can pass to Jest asking to watch files that have changed since the
//  last commit and execute tests related only to those changed files
// An optimization designed to make your tests run fast regardless of how many tests you have.

//* What To Test

// Test component renders
// Test component renders with props
// Test component renders in different states
// Test component reacts to events

//* What Not To Test

// Implementation details

// Third party code

// Code that is not important from a user point of view
