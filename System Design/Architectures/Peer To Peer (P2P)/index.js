// Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Architecture
/*
Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Architecture is a decentralized model where each participant (peer) in the network acts as both a client and a server. 
Peers can share resources, data, and services directly with each other without relying on a central server. 
P2P networks are commonly used in file sharing, distributed computing, and blockchain technologies. 
The architecture promotes scalability and resilience but may face challenges related to security and consistency.

Detailed Points:
- Decentralization: Each peer acts as both a client and a server.
- Scalability: More peers increase resource and data availability.
- Fault Tolerance: Network can be more resilient to failures without a central server.
- Examples: File-sharing networks (e.g., BitTorrent), blockchain networks, decentralized applications.

// Example:
// Simplified example of a P2P connection using WebRTC (conceptual)
const peerConnection = new RTCPeerConnection();

peerConnection.onicecandidate = (event) => {
  if (event.candidate) {
    // Send the ICE candidate to the other peer
    // Example code to send candidate to another peer
  }
};

// When a new peer connects, create an offer
peerConnection
  .createOffer()
  .then((offer) => {
    return peerConnection.setLocalDescription(offer);
  })
  .then(() => {
    // Send the offer to the other peer
    // Example code to send offer to another peer
  });
