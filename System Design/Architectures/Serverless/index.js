// Serverless Architecture
/*
Serverless Architecture allows developers to build and run applications without managing servers. 
Instead, the cloud provider manages the infrastructure and automatically handles scaling, patching, and maintenance. 
Developers write functions (often called "serverless functions") that are executed in response to events or triggers. 
This approach can reduce operational costs and complexity but may introduce challenges related to cold starts and debugging.

Detailed Points:
- Serverless Functions: Developers write functions that execute in response to events.
- Event-Driven: Functions are triggered by events such as HTTP requests or file uploads.
- Scaling: The cloud provider handles automatic scaling based on function demand.
- Cost: Typically, you only pay for the compute time consumed by functions.
- Examples: AWS Lambda functions, Google Cloud Functions.

// Example:
// AWS Lambda function example (Node.js)
exports.handler = async (event) => {
  console.log("Event:", JSON.stringify(event, null, 2));
  return "File processed successfully";
};
