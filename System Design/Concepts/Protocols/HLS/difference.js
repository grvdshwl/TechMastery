// Both HLS and DASH are adaptive streaming protocols used to deliver video content over the internet.
// They have several similarities but also some important differences.

// 1. Origin and Standardization:
//    - HLS: Developed by Apple and is not an open standard.
//           Primarily used in Apple's ecosystem, but widely adopted elsewhere as well.
//    - DASH: An international standard developed by MPEG (Moving Picture Experts Group).
//            It is an open standard and designed to be codec-agnostic.

// 2. File Formats and Containers:
//    - HLS: Uses MPEG-TS (Transport Stream) container format for video segments by default.
//           Recent versions also support fragmented MP4 (fMP4) to reduce latency and improve compatibility.
//    - DASH: Primarily uses fragmented MP4 (fMP4) as the container format for video segments.
//            Supports various codecs and container formats, providing more flexibility.

// 3. Playlist/Manifest Files:
//    - HLS: Uses M3U8 playlist files written in plain text.
//           There are two types of playlists: Master Playlist (lists available streams) and Media Playlist (lists segments for a stream).
//    - DASH: Uses XML-based MPD (Media Presentation Description) files.
//            The MPD file describes the available content, segment URLs, bitrates, and other metadata.

// Example of an HLS Master Playlist (M3U8):
/*
#EXTM3U
#EXT-X-STREAM-INF:BANDWIDTH=1280000
low.m3u8
#EXT-X-STREAM-INF:BANDWIDTH=2560000
mid.m3u8
#EXT-X-STREAM-INF:BANDWIDTH=5120000
high.m3u8
*/

// Example of a DASH MPD file:
/*
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<MPD xmlns="urn:mpeg:dash:schema:mpd:2011" type="static" mediaPresentationDuration="PT60M">
  <Period duration="PT60M">
    <AdaptationSet mimeType="video/mp4" codecs="avc1.4d401f" width="1280" height="720" frameRate="30">
      <Representation id="low" bandwidth="500000" codecs="avc1.4d401f" width="640" height="360">
        <BaseURL>http://example.com/low/</BaseURL>
        <SegmentTemplate duration="4" media="$Number$.mp4" startNumber="1" />
      </Representation>
      <Representation id="high" bandwidth="1500000" codecs="avc1.4d401f" width="1280" height="720">
        <BaseURL>http://example.com/high/</BaseURL>
        <SegmentTemplate duration="4" media="$Number$.mp4" startNumber="1" />
      </Representation>
    </AdaptationSet>
  </Period>
</MPD>

// 4. Latency:
//    - HLS: Typically has higher latency due to the use of longer segment durations (e.g., 6-10 seconds).
//           Apple's Low-Latency HLS (LL-HLS) reduces latency significantly by using shorter segments and partial segments.
//    - DASH: Generally supports lower latency than traditional HLS by using shorter segment durations (e.g., 2-4 seconds).
//            It can be further optimized for low latency using techniques like chunked transfer encoding.

// 5. Compatibility and Support:
//    - HLS: Native support on Apple devices (iOS, macOS, Apple TV).
//           Widely supported by various media players and streaming platforms.
//    - DASH: Supported by a wide range of devices and platforms, including modern web browsers via the Media Source Extensions (MSE) API.
//            Not natively supported on Apple devices without third-party players or workarounds.

// 6. DRM and Encryption:
//    - HLS: Supports AES-128 encryption and integration with DRM systems like FairPlay.
//    - DASH: Supports multiple DRM systems (e.g., Widevine, PlayReady, FairPlay) through Common Encryption (CENC).

// 7. Scalability and Flexibility:
//    - HLS: Simple to implement and deploy using standard HTTP infrastructure and CDNs.
//           More restrictive in terms of codecs and container formats compared to DASH.
//    - DASH: More flexible and scalable due to its codec-agnostic nature and support for various container formats.
//            Better suited for diverse environments and requirements.

// Summary:
// - HLS is a robust and widely adopted protocol, especially within the Apple ecosystem, with simpler implementation and good compatibility.
// - DASH is a more flexible and standardized protocol, providing better support for various codecs, lower latency, and broader device compatibility.
