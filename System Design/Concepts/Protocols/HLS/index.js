// HTTP Live Streaming (HLS) is a protocol developed by Apple for streaming audio and video over the Internet.

// Key features and components of HLS:

// 1. Segmentation:
//    - HLS breaks down media content into small segments, typically 2-10 seconds long.
//    - Each segment is an individual HTTP file, usually in the MPEG-TS format.

// 2. Manifest Files (Playlists):
//    - HLS uses M3U8 playlist files to describe the segments and their locations.
//    - There are two types of playlists:
//      - Master Playlist: Lists different streams available (e.g., different bitrates).
//      - Media Playlist: Lists the individual media segments for a specific bitrate.

// Example of a Master Playlist (M3U8):
/*
#EXTM3U
#EXT-X-STREAM-INF:BANDWIDTH=1280000
low.m3u8
#EXT-X-STREAM-INF:BANDWIDTH=2560000
mid.m3u8
#EXT-X-STREAM-INF:BANDWIDTH=5120000
high.m3u8
*/

// Example of a Media Playlist (M3U8):
/*
#EXTM3U
#EXT-X-TARGETDURATION:10
#EXTINF:10,
segment1.ts
#EXTINF:10,
segment2.ts
#EXTINF:10,
segment3.ts
*/

// 3. Adaptive Bitrate Streaming:
//    - HLS supports adaptive bitrate streaming, allowing the client to switch between different quality levels based on network conditions.
//    - The client automatically selects the most appropriate stream based on available bandwidth and CPU capacity.

// 4. HTTP-Based Delivery:
//    - HLS uses standard HTTP servers to deliver media segments and playlist files.
//    - This makes it easy to deploy and scale using existing HTTP infrastructure and CDNs.

// 5. Live and On-Demand Streaming:
//    - HLS can be used for both live streaming and on-demand content.
//    - For live streaming, the playlist is continuously updated with new segments as they are generated.

// 6. Encryption and DRM:
//    - HLS supports encryption of media segments to protect content.
// - It also supports integration with Digital Rights Management (DRM) systems for secure content delivery.

// How HLS works in practice:

// 1. The client requests the master playlist from the server.
// 2. The client parses the master playlist to determine the available streams and their bitrates.
// 3. The client requests the media playlist for the selected stream.
// 4. The client begins downloading and playing the media segments listed in the media playlist.
// 5. The client monitors network conditions and switches streams if necessary for optimal playback.

// Example of an HLS URL:
/*
http://example.com/live/master.m3u8
*/

// Benefits of HLS:
// - Adaptive bitrate streaming for smooth playback across varying network conditions.
// - HTTP-based delivery makes it easy to use with existing web infrastructure and CDNs.
// - Wide compatibility with different devices and platforms, including iOS, Android, and desktop browsers.

// HLS is widely used in the industry for delivering both live and on-demand video content,
// supported by various media players and streaming services.
