// RTMP stands for Real-Time Messaging Protocol
// It is a protocol developed by Adobe Systems for streaming audio, video, and data over the Internet.

// Key features and components of RTMP:

// 1. Persistent Connection:
//    - RTMP maintains a persistent TCP connection between the client and the server.
//    - This enables low-latency communication suitable for live streaming.

// 2. Three Variants:
//    - RTMP: The basic protocol for streaming data over TCP.
//    - RTMPS: RTMP over a secure SSL/TLS connection.
//    - RTMPE: RTMP with Adobe's own encryption method.

// 3. Chunk Stream:
//    - RTMP data is divided into chunks and sent over the network.
//    - This allows interleaving of different types of data (e.g., audio, video, control messages).

// 4. Message Types:
//    - RTMP supports various message types, including audio, video, data, and control messages.
//    - Each message type has a specific structure and purpose.

// Example of RTMP message types:
// - Audio message: Carries audio data.
// - Video message: Carries video data.
// - Data message: Carries metadata or user data.
// - Control message: Used for controlling the stream (e.g., set chunk size, acknowledge).

// 5. Handshake Process:
//    - The client and server perform a handshake to establish a connection.
//    - This involves exchanging several packets to agree on the communication parameters.

// 6. Stream Multiplexing:
//    - RTMP can carry multiple streams of data over a single connection.
//    - This allows for multiplexing of audio, video, and data streams in real-time.

// How RTMP works in practice:

// 1. Handshake:
//    - The client initiates a connection to the RTMP server.
//    - The client and server exchange handshake messages to establish the connection.

// 2. Connection Establishment:
//    - After the handshake, the client sends a connection request message to the server.
//    - The server responds with a connection response message indicating success or failure.

// 3. Stream Creation:
//    - The client sends a create stream message to the server to create a new stream.
//    - The server responds with a stream ID that the client uses to identify the stream.

// 4. Data Transmission:
//    - The client and server exchange audio, video, and data messages using the established stream.
//    - These messages are sent in chunks over the persistent connection.

// Example of an RTMP URL:
/*
rtmp://example.com/live/streamkey
*/

// Benefits of RTMP:
// - Low latency communication suitable for live streaming.
// - Support for multiple data types (audio, video, data).
// - Persistent connection ensures smooth data transmission.

// RTMP is widely used in live streaming applications, such as streaming to platforms like Twitch,
// YouTube Live, and Facebook Live. However, it is being gradually replaced by protocols like HLS
// and DASH due to better compatibility with modern HTTP-based infrastructure.
