// 1. Requirements Gathering
// Functional Requirements: What the system should do (features and capabilities).
// Non-Functional Requirements: Performance, scalability, security, maintainability, and usability requirements.

// 2. Scalability
// Vertical Scaling: Adding more power (CPU, RAM) to existing machines.
// Horizontal Scaling: Adding more machines to handle the load.
// Auto-Scaling: Automatically scaling resources based on demand.

// 3. Performance
// Latency: Time taken to process a request.
// Throughput: Number of requests processed in a given time period.
// Capacity Planning: Estimating the resources needed to handle expected load.

// 4. Reliability and Availability
// Redundancy: Adding duplicate components to eliminate single points of failure.
// Failover Mechanisms: Automatically switching to a backup component in case of failure.
// Uptime Requirements: The amount of time the system should be operational.

// 5. Consistency and Data Integrity
// Consistency Models: Strong consistency, eventual consistency, causal consistency.
// Data Validation: Ensuring data integrity through constraints and validation mechanisms.
// Transaction Management: Handling multiple operations as a single unit of work.

// 6. Security
// Authentication: Verifying the identity of users or systems.
// Authorization: Granting or denying access to resources based on identity.
// Data Encryption: Protecting data at rest and in transit.
// Vulnerability Management: Identifying and addressing security vulnerabilities.

// 7. Maintainability
// Code Quality: Writing clean, understandable, and modular code.
// Documentation: Providing comprehensive documentation for developers and users.
// Logging and Monitoring: Tracking system behavior and performance.
// Automated Testing: Implementing unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests.

// 8. Cost Efficiency
// Cost of Resources: Estimating the cost of infrastructure, such as servers, storage, and bandwidth.
// Operational Costs: Considering ongoing maintenance and support costs.
// Cost Optimization: Identifying ways to minimize costs while meeting performance requirements.

// 9. Technology Stack
// Choosing the Right Tools: Selecting appropriate programming languages, frameworks, and libraries.
// Database Selection: Picking the right type of database (SQL, NoSQL, NewSQL) based on requirements.
// Third-Party Services: Evaluating the use of third-party services and APIs.

// 10. User Experience
// User Interface (UI): Designing an intuitive and responsive interface.
// User Interaction: Ensuring smooth and efficient user interactions.
// Accessibility: Making the system accessible to all users, including those with disabilities.

// 11. Compliance and Legal Considerations
// Regulations: Complying with relevant regulations (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA).
// Data Privacy: Protecting user data and ensuring privacy.
// Licensing: Ensuring compliance with software licenses and intellectual property laws.

// 12. Future Proofing
// Extensibility: Designing the system to accommodate future growth and changes.
// Modularity: Creating modular components that can be easily updated or replaced.
// Backward Compatibility: Ensuring new changes do not break existing functionality.
