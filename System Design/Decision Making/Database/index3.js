/**
 * Couchbase
 * =========
 * Pros:
 * - Combines the strengths of a key-value store and a document store.
 * - High performance with built-in caching.
 * - Full-text search, indexing, and SQL-like query language (N1QL).
 * - Easy scalability with automatic sharding and replication.
 *
 * Cons:
 * - Can be complex to configure and optimize.
 * - Memory consumption can be high due to caching mechanisms.
 * - Limited support for cross-datacenter replication.

/**
 * DynamoDB
 * ========
 * Pros:
 * - Fully managed by AWS with seamless scalability.
 * - Automatic replication across multiple availability zones.
 * - Fine-grained access control with IAM integration.
 * - Supports both document and key-value data models.
 *
 * Cons:
 * - Limited querying capabilities, especially without secondary indexes.
 * - Costs can escalate with high throughput and storage needs.
 * - Vendor lock-in as itâ€™s tightly integrated with AWS services.
 *
 * Use Cases:
 * - Applications requiring managed scaling and availability.
 * - Serverless architectures and microservices on AWS.
 * - IoT, gaming, and applications requiring predictable performance.

/**
 * Graph Databases (e.g., Neo4j)
 * =============================
 * Pros:
 * - Efficiently handles complex relationships between data.
 * - Flexible schema, ideal for dynamic data models.
 * - Excellent for traversing relationships with fast, recursive queries.
 * - Intuitive data model using nodes and relationships, often mirroring real-world scenarios.
 *
 * Cons:
 * - Can be less performant for simple, flat data structures.
 * - Generally not as horizontally scalable as other NoSQL databases.
 * - May require a steep learning curve for those unfamiliar with graph theory.
 *
 * Use Cases:
 * - Social networks, recommendation engines, and fraud detection.
 * - Applications requiring complex relationship queries, like knowledge graphs.
 * - Situations where relationships are as important as the data itself.
 */

/**
 * Elasticsearch
 * =============
 * Pros:
 * - Powerful full-text search capabilities with complex queries.
 * - Distributed architecture, designed for horizontal scaling.
 * - Near real-time indexing and search performance.
 * - Supports structured, unstructured, and semi-structured data.
 *
 * Cons:
 * - High memory consumption, especially with large indexes.
 * - Indexing can be resource-intensive and may lead to slower performance for heavy writes.
 * - Requires careful configuration and tuning for optimal performance.
 *
 * Use Cases:
 * - Search engines and applications requiring full-text search.
 * - Log and event data analysis, real-time analytics.
 * - E-commerce platforms for product search and recommendations.
