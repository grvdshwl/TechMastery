/**
 * Three-tier Architecture:
 *
 * The three-tier architecture is a client-server software architecture pattern that
 * separates applications into three logical and physical tiers: the Presentation Tier,
 * the Logic Tier, and the Data Tier. This separation helps manage complexity and
 * enables scalability, maintainability, and flexibility.
 *
 * 1. Presentation Tier (Client Tier):
 *    - Definition: The topmost level of the application, responsible for displaying
 *      information to the user and handling user interactions.
 *    - Components: User interfaces (UI) such as web pages, mobile apps, or desktop
 *      applications.
 *    - Responsibilities:
 *      - Display data to users.
 *      - Capture user input and send it to the Logic Tier.
 *      - Handle user interactions (e.g., clicking buttons, filling forms).
 *    - Technologies: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Angular, Vue.js, Swift, Kotlin.
 *
 * 2. Logic Tier (Application Tier or Middle Tier):
 *    - Definition: The middle layer, responsible for processing application logic,
 *      business rules, and data transformation.
 *    - Components: Application servers, business logic, APIs, and microservices.
 *    - Responsibilities:
 *      - Process user requests from the Presentation Tier.
 *      - Apply business rules and logic.
 *      - Communicate with the Data Tier to fetch or store data.
 *      - Send processed data back to the Presentation Tier.
 *    - Technologies: Node.js, Java, .NET, Python, Ruby, Spring Boot, Express.js.
 *
 * 3. Data Tier (Database Tier):
 *    - Definition: The bottom layer, responsible for managing and storing data.
 *    - Components: Database management systems (DBMS), data storage, and data access
 *      logic.
 *    - Responsibilities:
 *      - Store and retrieve data.
 *      - Manage database connections and queries.
 *      - Ensure data integrity and security.
 *    - Technologies: MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Oracle, SQL Server, Redis.
 *
 * Pros of Three-tier Architecture:
 * 1. Separation of Concerns: Each tier focuses on specific responsibilities, improving
 *    maintainability and scalability.
 * 2. Scalability: Each tier can be scaled independently to handle increased load.
 * 3. Maintainability: Changes in one tier do not necessarily impact the other tiers,
 *    making it easier to update and maintain.
 * 4. Flexibility: Different technologies can be used for each tier, allowing the best
 *    tools for each job.
 * 5. Security: Each tier can have its own security measures, improving overall security.
 *
 * Cons of Three-tier Architecture:
 * 1. Complexity: Introducing multiple tiers adds complexity to the application
 *    architecture and deployment.
 * 2. Performance: Communication between tiers can introduce latency, affecting
 *    performance.
 * 3. Cost: More resources are required to manage and maintain separate tiers.
 *
 * Use Case Scenarios for Three-tier Architecture:
 * 1. Web Applications: E-commerce sites, social media platforms, and content management
 *    systems benefit from the separation of concerns.
 * 2. Enterprise Applications: Large-scale business applications (ERP, CRM) that require
 *    robust and scalable architecture.
 * 3. Mobile Applications: Backend services for mobile apps, providing a clear separation
 *    between the user interface and server-side logic.
 *
 * Example of Three-tier Architecture:
 * - A user interacts with a web application (Presentation Tier) by submitting a form.
 * - The form data is sent to the server (Logic Tier), where business logic processes
 *   the data.
 * - The Logic Tier queries the database (Data Tier) to store or retrieve information.
 * - The processed data is sent back to the web application (Presentation Tier) to
 *   update the UI.
