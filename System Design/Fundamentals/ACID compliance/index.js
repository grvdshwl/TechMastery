//* ACID compliance
/**
 * ACID Compliance:
 *
 * ACID is an acronym that stands for Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability.
 * These are the key properties that define the reliability of database transactions,
 * ensuring data integrity even in the event of errors, power failures, or other issues.
 *
 * 1. Atomicity:
 *    - Definition: Ensures that each transaction is treated as a single "unit of work".
 *      This means that either all operations within the transaction are completed
 *      successfully, or none of them are.
 *    - Example: In a banking system, if you transfer money from Account A to Account B,
 *      the transaction will only succeed if both the debit from Account A and the credit
 *      to Account B are successful. If either operation fails, neither will be applied.
 *
 * 2. Consistency:
 *    - Definition: Ensures that a transaction brings the database from one valid state
 *      to another, maintaining database rules such as constraints, triggers, and
 *      cascades.
 *    - Example: After a transaction, all data should be valid according to all defined
 *      rules. For instance, in a database with a unique constraint on email addresses,
 *      a transaction that results in duplicate emails would not be consistent.
 *
 * 3. Isolation:
 *    - Definition: Ensures that concurrently executed transactions do not interfere
 *      with each other. Each transaction should operate as if it is the only one in
 *      the system.
 *    - Example: If two transactions are trying to update the same record, isolation
 *      ensures that one transaction's changes do not affect the other until one of them
 *      is completed.
 *
 * 4. Durability:
 *    - Definition: Ensures that once a transaction has been committed, it will remain
 *      in the system even in the case of a system crash or power failure.
 *    - Example: If a transaction completes and the system crashes immediately afterward,
 *      the changes made by the transaction will still be present when the system
 *      restarts.
 *
 * Benefits of ACID Compliance:
 * - Reliability: Ensures data integrity and reliability in all situations, making
 *   the database trustworthy.
 * - Predictability: Provides predictable behavior of transactions, which is crucial
 *   for applications requiring strict data consistency.
 * - Error Handling: Simplifies error handling in applications, as developers can
 *   rely on the database to maintain integrity.
 *
 * Drawbacks of ACID Compliance:
 * - Performance: Can impact performance due to the overhead of ensuring all four
 *   properties, especially in high-concurrency or distributed systems.
 * - Scalability: Maintaining ACID properties across distributed databases can be
 *   challenging and can limit scalability.
 *
 * Use Case Scenarios for ACID Compliance:
 * - Financial Systems: Transactions involving money require high reliability and
 *   consistency (e.g., banking, stock trading).
 * - E-commerce Platforms: Ensuring accurate order processing, inventory management,
 *   and customer information.
 * - Healthcare Systems: Maintaining the integrity of patient records and sensitive
 *   information.
