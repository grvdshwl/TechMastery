// API vs. SDK: Understanding the Difference

// API (Application Programming Interface):
// Definition: An API is a set of rules and protocols that allows one software 
// application to interact with another. It defines the methods and data structures 
// that developers can use to communicate with a service, operating system, library, 
// or other software components.

// Purpose: APIs enable integration between different systems, allowing them to share 
// data and functionalities.

// Types:
// 1. Web APIs: Accessed over the internet using HTTP/HTTPS protocols. 
//    Examples: RESTful APIs, SOAP APIs.
// 2. Library APIs: Provided by programming libraries to use pre-defined functions 
//    or classes. 
//    Example: Math libraries that offer mathematical functions.
// 3. Operating System APIs: Interfaces provided by an OS to interact with hardware 
//    or manage system resources.
//    Example: Windows API, POSIX in Unix-based systems.



// SDK (Software Development Kit):
// Definition: An SDK is a comprehensive set of development tools that includes 
// libraries, documentation, code samples, processes, and guides that developers use 
// to build applications for a specific platform or service.

// Purpose: SDKs are designed to facilitate the development of software applications, 
// providing everything a developer needs to get started and integrate specific functionalities.

// Components:
// 1. APIs: SDKs often include APIs that developers can use.
// 2. Tools: This can include compilers, debuggers, and development environments.
// 3. Documentation: Guides and manuals explaining how to use the tools and APIs.
// 4. Sample Code: Examples that demonstrate common use cases and best practices.


// Comparison and Relationship:
// - Scope: APIs are more narrowly focused, providing specific interfaces to interact 
//   with software components. SDKs are broader, encompassing APIs along with other 
//   tools and resources for comprehensive software development.
// - Usage: APIs are used to communicate with and utilize services or components. 
//   SDKs are used to develop applications that might include using APIs as part of the functionality.
// - Integration: An SDK may include multiple APIs and tools, whereas an API is typically 
//   a single interface. For example, a cloud service SDK might include APIs for various 
//   services (storage, computation, etc.), along with tools for managing these services.

// In summary, while an API allows for communication and interaction with a service 
// or component, an SDK provides all the tools necessary to build an application, 
// often including one or more APIs.
