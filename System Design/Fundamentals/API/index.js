/**
 * API (Application Programming Interface):
 *
 * An API is a set of rules and protocols that allows different software applications
 * to communicate with each other. It defines the methods and data formats that applications
 * can use to request and exchange information. APIs are used to enable integration
 * between different systems and services.
 *
 * Key Concepts:
 *
 * 1. Endpoint:
 *    - Definition: A specific URL or URI where an API can be accessed by an application.
 *      It represents a particular resource or service.
 *    - Example: `https://api.example.com/users` might be an endpoint to access user data.
 *
 * 2. Request:
 *    - Definition: A message sent by the client to the API endpoint requesting some action
 *      or information.
 *    - Components: HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE), headers, query parameters,
 *      and body (for POST/PUT requests).
 *    - Example: A GET request to `https://api.example.com/users` to retrieve a list of users.
 *
 * 3. Response:
 *    - Definition: A message sent by the API back to the client, containing the result
 *      of the request. It usually includes a status code, headers, and a body.
 *    - Components: HTTP status code (e.g., 200 OK, 404 Not Found), headers, and response body.
 *    - Example: A response to the GET request might include a JSON object with user data.
 *
 * 4. Authentication:
 *    - Definition: Mechanisms used to verify the identity of the client making the request.
 *      Common methods include API keys, OAuth, and JWT (JSON Web Tokens).
 *    - Example: Including an API key in the request header for accessing a secure endpoint.
 *
 * 5. Rate Limiting:
 *    - Definition: A technique used to control the number of requests a client can make
 *      to the API in a given time period to prevent abuse or overloading the server.
 *    - Example: An API may limit clients to 1000 requests per hour.
 *
 * 6. Data Format:
 *    - Definition: The format in which data is exchanged between the client and the API.
 *      Common formats include JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) and XML (eXtensible Markup Language).
 *    - Example: An API might return data in JSON format like `{ "id": 1, "name": "Alice" }`.
 *
 * Types of APIs:
 *
 * 1. REST (Representational State Transfer):
 *    - Definition: A popular architectural style for designing networked applications.
 *      REST APIs use standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and are typically stateless.
 *    - Characteristics: Resource-based, uses URLs to represent resources, and relies on
 *      HTTP status codes.
 *    - Example: `https://api.example.com/users` to manage user data.
 *
 * 2. SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol):
 *    - Definition: A protocol for exchanging structured information in web services using XML.
 *    - Characteristics: Requires a strict XML-based message format and includes a WSDL
 *      (Web Services Description Language) for defining the service.
 *    - Example: An API for financial transactions that requires SOAP for request and response.
 *
 * 3. GraphQL:
 *    - Definition: A query language for APIs that allows clients to request exactly the data
 *      they need. It enables flexible queries and is often used with a single endpoint.
 *    - Characteristics: Allows clients to specify the structure of the response, reducing
 *      over-fetching or under-fetching of data.
 *    - Example: A query like `{ user(id: 1) { name, email } }` to get specific user details.
 *
 * Benefits of Using APIs:
 * 1. Integration: Enables different systems and services to work together and share data.
 * 2. Efficiency: Provides a standardized way to access functionality and data.
 * 3. Flexibility: Allows for modular development and easier updates or changes.
 * 4. Automation: Facilitates automation of tasks and interactions between systems.
 *
 * Use Case Scenarios for APIs:
 * 1. Social Media: Integrating social media features into applications (e.g., posting updates,
 *    retrieving user profiles).
 * 2. Payment Processing: Connecting with payment gateways to handle transactions (e.g.,
 *    Stripe, PayPal).
 * 3. Data Retrieval: Accessing data from third-party services (e.g., weather data, stock prices).
 * 4. Authentication: Using OAuth or other authentication services to manage user access.
