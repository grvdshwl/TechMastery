// CAP Theorem Explanation in JavaScript

// The CAP Theorem states that in a distributed data store, we can only achieve two out of three guarantees:
// Consistency (C), Availability (A), and Partition Tolerance (P) simultaneously.

// 1. Consistency (C):
// - This means that all nodes in the distributed system see the same data at the same time.
// - After a data write, all subsequent reads will reflect that write.
// - Example: In a banking system, if a user transfers money, all systems should immediately show the updated balance.
// - Trade-off: Achieving consistency can introduce latency due to the need for coordination among nodes.

// 2. Availability (A):
// - Availability ensures that every request receives a response, whether successful or failed.
// - This means the system remains operational, even if some parts of the system are down.
// - Example: An online retail system should be able to show product information even if some backend services are unavailable.
// - Trade-off: Ensuring high availability can sometimes mean serving outdated data if parts of the system are out of sync.

// 3. Partition Tolerance (P):
// - Partition tolerance means the system continues to operate despite network partitions or communication breakdowns.
// - In practice, this is essential for any distributed system because network failures are inevitable.
// - Example: In a global system with servers in different regions, the system should still function if network issues isolate one region.
// - Trade-off: Systems must handle data replication and conflict resolution to maintain partition tolerance.

// CAP Theorem Trade-offs:
// - The theorem posits that it is impossible for a distributed system to simultaneously provide all three guarantees in the face of a network partition.

// CA (Consistency + Availability):
// - In this model, the system provides consistent data and remains available, but only as long as there are no network partitions.
// - Example: Traditional relational databases in a single location where partitions are unlikely.

// CP (Consistency + Partition Tolerance):
// - This model prioritizes consistency and partition tolerance but may sacrifice availability during network issues.
// - Example: Systems where accurate data is crucial, like financial applications. During a partition, some data may be inaccessible to ensure consistency.

// AP (Availability + Partition Tolerance):
// - This model ensures that the system remains available and partition-tolerant, but it might not be consistent across all nodes.
// - Example: Social media feeds where immediate consistency is less critical than availability. Users might see slightly different data during a partition.

// Practical Considerations:
// - Eventual Consistency: Often used in AP systems, it means that while data may be inconsistent temporarily, all nodes will eventually converge to the same state.
// - Real-world systems typically design for partition tolerance because network partitions, while rare, can still occur.
// - The choice between CA, CP, and AP models depends on the specific requirements and constraints of the application being developed.
