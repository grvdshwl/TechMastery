// Example: How Netflix Uses a CDN

// 1. Netflix Content Storage:
// - Netflix hosts a vast library of movies and TV shows.
// - These videos are stored on Netflix's origin servers, where the original high-quality files are kept.

// 2. Use of CDN Edge Servers:
// - Netflix uses a CDN to deliver content to its global audience.
// - The CDN has many edge servers located around the world. These servers store cached copies of Netflix's videos.
// - This distributed network of servers ensures that content is available close to the user, regardless of their location.

// 3. Content Caching Process:
// - When a user starts watching a video on Netflix, the request is routed to the nearest CDN edge server.
// - If the requested video is already cached on that server (a cache hit), the server delivers it directly to the user.
// - If the video is not cached (a cache miss), the edge server fetches the video from the nearest CDN server or Netflix's origin server, caches it, and then streams it to the user.

// 4. Benefits for Netflix and Users:

// - Faster Streaming:
//   - By delivering content from nearby edge servers, Netflix reduces buffering and loading times.
//   - This improves the viewing experience, as users can start watching videos almost immediately.

// - Reduced Bandwidth and Load:
//   - The CDN reduces the load on Netflix's origin servers, as most data requests are handled by the CDN's edge servers.
//   - This decreases Netflix's bandwidth costs and helps manage traffic more efficiently, especially during peak viewing times.

// - High Availability and Reliability:
//   - With a global network of servers, Netflix can provide uninterrupted service even if one server or data center experiences issues.
//   - This redundancy ensures that users can always access their favorite shows and movies.

// - Scalability:
//   - Netflix experiences high traffic, especially during new releases or popular events.
//   - The CDN allows Netflix to scale easily, handling millions of simultaneous streams without degrading the quality of service.

// - Improved Security:
//   - CDNs can provide additional layers of security, helping Netflix protect its content from piracy and unauthorized access.
//   - CDNs also offer DDoS protection, safeguarding Netflix from potential cyber-attacks that could disrupt service.

// In summary, Netflix uses a CDN to efficiently deliver high-quality video content to its users worldwide. The CDN's distributed network of servers enhances streaming speed, reduces server load, ensures reliability, scales to meet demand, and bolsters security. This infrastructure is crucial for providing a smooth, consistent viewing experience for millions of Netflix users globally.
