/**
 * Cache:
 *
 * Caching is a technique used to store frequently accessed data in a temporary storage
 * location, known as a cache, to improve the performance and efficiency of applications
 * and systems. By reducing the time and resources needed to access this data, caching
 * enhances the user experience and reduces the load on backend systems.
 *
 * Key Concepts:
 *
 * 1. Types of Cache:
 *    - Browser Cache: Stores web resources (e.g., HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images) on the
 *      user's device to speed up page load times.
 *    - Server Cache: Stores frequently accessed data on the server side to reduce the
 *      time taken to generate responses.
 *    - CDN (Content Delivery Network) Cache: Caches content at various locations worldwide
 *      to serve users from the nearest location, reducing latency.
 *    - Database Cache: Caches database query results to reduce the load on the database.
 *    - Application Cache: Stores application-specific data to avoid repeated computations
 *      or data fetches.
 *
 * 2. Cache Storage:
 *    - In-Memory: Uses RAM for storage, providing fast read and write access. Examples
 *      include Redis and Memcached.
 *    - Disk-Based: Stores cached data on disk, which is slower than in-memory but can
 *      handle larger data sets. Examples include Varnish Cache and local disk caching.
 *
 * 3. Cache Invalidation:
 *    - Definition: The process of removing or updating stale data in the cache to ensure
 *      data consistency.
 *    - Methods:
 *      - Time-to-Live (TTL): Data is automatically removed from the cache after a specified period.
 *      - Manual Invalidation: Data is explicitly removed or updated in the cache based on
 *        application logic.
 *      - Write-Through: Data is updated in both the cache and the underlying data store
 *        simultaneously.
 *      - Write-Back (Lazy Write): Data is initially written to the cache and later written
 *        to the underlying data store.
 *
 * 4. Cache Strategies:
 *    - Cache-Aside (Lazy Loading): Data is loaded into the cache only when requested. If the
 *      data is not in the cache, it is fetched from the primary data store, added to the cache,
 *      and then returned.
 *    - Write-Through: Data is written to the cache and the primary data store simultaneously.
 *    - Write-Back (Write-Behind): Data is written to the cache first and asynchronously written
 *      to the primary data store.
 *    - Read-Through: Similar to cache-aside, but the cache itself is responsible for fetching
 *      data from the primary data store if not present.
 *
 * Advantages of Caching:
 *
 * 1. Improved Performance:
 *    - Reduces data retrieval time by storing frequently accessed data in a faster storage medium.
 *    - Decreases latency and improves response times for end users.
 *
 * 2. Reduced Load:
 *    - Lowers the load on primary data stores (e.g., databases) by serving data from the cache.
 *    - Reduces network congestion by caching data closer to the user.
 *
 * 3. Cost Efficiency:
 *    - Reduces the need for expensive and resource-intensive operations by serving data from the cache.
 *
 * 4. Scalability:
 *    - Enhances the ability to scale applications by offloading frequent data requests to the cache.
 *
 * 5. Improved User Experience:
 *    - Provides faster access to data, resulting in a smoother and more responsive user experience.
 *
 * Disadvantages of Caching:
 *
 * 1. Data Staleness:
 *    - Cached data can become outdated if not properly invalidated, leading to inconsistent or incorrect data.
 *
 * 2. Memory Consumption:
 *    - In-memory caching can consume significant amounts of RAM, potentially affecting other processes.
 *
 * 3. Complexity:
 *    - Implementing and managing cache invalidation and synchronization can add complexity to the application.
 *
 * Example Scenario:
 *
 * - A news website uses caching to store the most recent articles. When a user visits the site,
 *   the articles are served from the cache, resulting in faster page load times and reduced
 *   load on the database. The cache is updated at regular intervals or whenever new articles are
 *   published to ensure the data remains fresh.
