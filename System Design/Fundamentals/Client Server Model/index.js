/**
 * Client-Server Model:
 *
 * The client-server model is a distributed application structure that divides tasks or workloads
 * between two main entities: clients and servers. Clients request services or resources, and
 * servers provide those services or resources. This model is foundational to the architecture
 * of many networked applications, including the internet.
 *
 * Key Concepts:
 *
 * 1. Client:
 *    - Definition: A client is a device or program that requests services or resources from
 *      a server. Clients initiate communication with servers.
 *    - Examples: Web browsers (Chrome, Firefox), email clients, mobile apps, and desktop
 *      applications.
 *    - Responsibilities:
 *      - Sending requests to the server.
 *      - Displaying or processing the server's responses.
 *      - Managing user interactions and interface.
 *
 * 2. Server:
 *    - Definition: A server is a device or program that provides services or resources to
 *      clients. Servers respond to client requests.
 *    - Examples: Web servers (Apache, Nginx), database servers (MySQL, PostgreSQL), file servers.
 *    - Responsibilities:
 *      - Receiving and processing client requests.
 *      - Managing resources, data storage, and business logic.
 *      - Sending responses back to clients.
 *
 * How the Client-Server Model Works:
 *
 * 1. Client Initiates Communication:
 *    - The client sends a request to the server over a network (e.g., HTTP request for a web page).
 *
 * 2. Server Processes Request:
 *    - The server receives the request, processes it (e.g., querying a database, executing business
 *      logic), and prepares a response.
 *
 * 3. Server Sends Response:
 *    - The server sends the response back to the client (e.g., HTML content, data in JSON format).
 *
 * 4. Client Receives and Processes Response:
 *    - The client receives the response and processes it (e.g., rendering a web page, updating
 *      the user interface).
 *
 * Advantages of the Client-Server Model:
 *
 * 1. Centralized Resources:
 *    - Servers can centralize resources, data, and management, making it easier to maintain
 *      and update systems.
 *
 * 2. Scalability:
 *    - Clients and servers can be scaled independently. More clients can be added, and server
 *      capacity can be increased as needed.
 *
 * 3. Security:
 *    - Centralized servers can enforce security policies, access controls, and data protection
 *      measures.
 *
 * 4. Maintenance:
 *    - Centralized management of servers allows for easier updates, backups, and maintenance.
 *
 * 5. Efficiency:
 *    - Efficient use of resources, as servers can handle multiple client requests simultaneously
 *      and balance load.
 *
 * Disadvantages of the Client-Server Model:
 *
 * 1. Single Point of Failure:
 *    - If the server goes down or becomes overloaded, clients cannot access services or resources.
 *
 * 2. Network Dependency:
 *    - The client-server model relies on network connectivity. Poor network performance can
 *      affect the communication between clients and servers.
 *
 * 3. Cost:
 *    - Maintaining and scaling servers can be costly, requiring investments in hardware,
 *      software, and skilled personnel.
 *
 * Example Scenario:
 *
 * - A user opens a web browser (client) and enters a URL to visit a website. The browser sends
 *   an HTTP request to the web server (server) hosting the website.
 * - The web server receives the request, processes it (e.g., retrieves data from a database),
 *   and sends back an HTML response.
 * - The browser receives the HTML response and renders the web page for the user to view and
 *   interact with.
