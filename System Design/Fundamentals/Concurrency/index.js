/**
 * Concurrency:
 * 
 * Concurrency refers to the ability of a system to execute multiple tasks or processes 
 * simultaneously or in overlapping time periods. It allows an application to make progress 
 * on multiple tasks without waiting for each task to complete sequentially. Concurrency 
 * can be achieved through various techniques, including multi-threading, multi-processing, 
 * and asynchronous programming.
 * 
 * Key Concepts:
 * 
 * 1. Threads:
 *    - Definition: The smallest unit of execution within a process. A process can contain 
 *      multiple threads that share the same memory space.
 *    - Example: In a web server, each incoming request can be handled by a separate thread.
 * 
 * 2. Processes:
 *    - Definition: Independent units of execution that run in separate memory spaces. Each 
 *      process has its own memory and resources.
 *    - Example: Running multiple instances of a database server on the same machine.
 * 
 * 3. Asynchronous Programming:
 *    - Definition: A programming paradigm where tasks can start, run, and complete at 
 *      different times. Asynchronous tasks do not block the main execution flow.
 *    - Example: In JavaScript, using Promises or async/await to handle asynchronous 
 *      operations like network requests.
 * 
 * 4. Synchronization:
 *    - Definition: Techniques used to control the access of multiple threads or processes 
 *      to shared resources to avoid conflicts and ensure data consistency.
 *    - Example: Using locks, semaphores, or monitors to manage access to a shared variable.
 * 
 * 5. Race Conditions:
 *    - Definition: A situation where the outcome of a program depends on the sequence or 
 *      timing of uncontrollable events, leading to unpredictable behavior.
 *    - Example: Two threads trying to increment the same counter simultaneously without 
 *      proper synchronization.
 * 
 * Techniques for Achieving Concurrency:
 * 
 * 1. Multi-Threading:
 *    - Definition: Creating multiple threads within a single process to perform different 
 *      tasks concurrently.
 *    - Example: A web server handling multiple client requests simultaneously using threads.
 * 
 * 2. Multi-Processing:
 *    - Definition: Running multiple processes simultaneously, each with its own memory 
 *      space and resources.
 *    - Example: A data processing application running separate processes for different 
 *      stages of the pipeline.
 * 
 * 3. Asynchronous Programming:
 *    - Definition: Using non-blocking operations and callbacks to perform tasks 
 *      concurrently without creating new threads or processes.
 *    - Example: Using async/await in JavaScript to handle asynchronous I/O operations.
 * 
 * 4. Event-Driven Programming:
 *    - Definition: A programming paradigm where the flow of the program is determined by 
 *      events such as user actions, sensor outputs, or messages from other programs.
 *    - Example: A JavaScript event loop handling multiple events (clicks, key presses) 
 *      concurrently.
 * 
 * Advantages of Concurrency:
 * 
 * 1. Improved Performance:
 *    - Allows multiple tasks to run simultaneously, making better use of CPU resources and 
 *      reducing idle time.
 * 
 * 2. Responsiveness:
 *    - Improves the responsiveness of applications, especially in user interfaces, by 
 *      handling multiple tasks concurrently.
 * 
 * 3. Scalability:
 *    - Enhances the ability to handle increased load by running multiple tasks or processes 
 *      concurrently.
 * 
 * 4. Resource Utilization:
 *    - Maximizes resource utilization by performing tasks in parallel, especially in 
 *      multi-core and multi-processor systems.
 * 
 * Disadvantages of Concurrency:
 * 
 * 1. Complexity:
 *    - Adds complexity to the design and implementation of applications, making them harder 
 *      to develop, test, and debug.
 * 
 * 2. Synchronization Issues:
 *    - Requires careful management of shared resources to avoid race conditions, deadlocks, 
 *      and other synchronization issues.
 * 
 * 3. Overhead:
 *    - Can introduce overhead due to context switching, thread management, and synchronization 
 *      mechanisms.
 * 
 * Example Scenario:
 * 
 * - A web application server handles multiple client requests concurrently. Each request is 
 *   processed in a separate thread, allowing the server to handle many requests at the same 
 *   time. The server uses asynchronous I/O to read data from the database and send responses 
 *   to clients without blocking the main execution flow.
