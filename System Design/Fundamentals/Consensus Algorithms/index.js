/**
 * Consensus Algorithms
 * --------------------
 * Consensus algorithms are protocols used to achieve agreement on a single data value or state across distributed
 * systems or networks. These algorithms ensure that all nodes (or participants) in the system agree on a certain
 * outcome, even in the presence of failures or unreliable communication.
 *
 * Key Points:
 * -----------
 * 1. **Fault Tolerance**: Consensus algorithms are designed to work correctly even if some nodes fail or behave maliciously.
 *    This property is crucial for ensuring the reliability of distributed systems.
 * 2. **Consistency**: All correct nodes in the network should have a consistent view of the state or value, ensuring that
 *    once consensus is reached, all participants agree on the same result.
 * 3. **Liveness**: The algorithm ensures that the system will eventually reach consensus, i.e., it doesn't get stuck indefinitely.
 * 4. **Leader Election**: Many consensus algorithms elect a leader or coordinator who drives the decision-making process,
 *    ensuring that the consensus is efficiently reached.
 * 5. **Agreement**: All nodes must agree on a common decision (value or state).
 * 6. **Popular Algorithms**:
 *    - **Paxos**: A consensus protocol that ensures safety and correctness but is relatively complex.
 *    - **Raft**: A simplified consensus protocol that is easier to understand and implement compared to Paxos.
 *    - **Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT)**: A class of consensus algorithms designed to tolerate malicious behavior (Byzantine failures).
 *    - **Proof of Work (PoW)**: Common in blockchain systems like Bitcoin, where nodes solve computational puzzles to reach consensus.
 *
 * Use Case: Distributed Database Replication
 * ------------------------------------------
 * Scenario:
 * - A company is running a distributed database across multiple nodes in different regions.
 * - To ensure consistency and fault tolerance, they need to make sure that all the nodes in the network agree on which
 *   updates to apply in case of concurrent modifications or network failures.
 *
 * Solution:
 * - Implement a consensus algorithm like **Raft** to ensure that all nodes in the distributed database agree on the
 *   order of transactions. This guarantees that data is replicated correctly, and the system remains fault-tolerant.
 *
 * Example: Simulating a Simple Raft-Like Consensus Algorithm in JavaScript

  requestVote() {
    console.log(`Node ${this.id} is requesting votes.`);

class RaftCluster {
  constructor(nodes) {
    this.nodes = nodes;
    this.leader = null;
  }

  // Simulate an election
  electLeader() {
    console.log("Starting leader election...");
    for (let node of this.nodes) {
      const gotVote = node.requestVote();
      if (gotVote) {
        node.votesReceived++;
      }
    }

    // Select the node with the most votes as the leader
    const electedNode = this.nodes.reduce((prev, curr) =>
      curr.votesReceived > prev.votesReceived ? curr : prev
    );
    this.leader = electedNode;
    console.log(`Node ${this.leader.id} is elected as the leader!`);
  }
}

// Create nodes representing a cluster of distributed systems
const nodes = [new Node(1), new Node(2), new Node(3), new Node(4), new Node(5)];

// Initialize the Raft cluster
const raftCluster = new RaftCluster(nodes);

// Start an election to select a leader
raftCluster.electLeader();

/**
 * Explanation:
 * ------------
 * 1. **Node Class**: Each node represents a participant in the system. Each node can request votes from other nodes.
 * 2. **RaftCluster Class**: This class simulates a cluster of nodes where a leader election takes place.
 * 3. **Election Process**: Nodes request votes from other nodes, and the node with the most votes is elected as the leader.
 *    This mimics the leader election phase in the Raft consensus algorithm.
 * 4. **Random Voting**: In this simulation, a node's request for votes is randomly accepted or rejected.
 *
 * User Case: Distributed Ledger (Blockchain)
 * ------------------------------------------
 * Scenario:
 * - A blockchain-based system relies on consensus to agree on the order of transactions and validate new blocks.
 *
 * Solution:
 * - Implement a **Proof of Work (PoW)** or **Proof of Stake (PoS)** consensus mechanism to ensure that all nodes
 *   (miners or validators) agree on which block to add to the chain. This ensures the blockchain remains immutable
 *   and trustworthy.
 *
 * Benefits of Consensus Algorithms:
 * ---------------------------------
 * 1. **Fault Tolerance**: They ensure system reliability even if some nodes fail or behave maliciously.
 * 2. **Consistency**: All correct nodes will agree on a single state or value, preventing divergence in distributed systems.
 * 3. **Leader Election**: A leader is often elected to coordinate the process, improving efficiency.
 * 4. **Scalability**: Consensus algorithms enable distributed systems to scale by allowing agreement across a large
 *    number of nodes.
 * 5. **Resilience to Network Failures**: Consensus algorithms handle network partitions and ensure eventual consistency.
 *
 * Real-World Scenario: Raft in Kubernetes
 * ---------------------------------------
 * - **Kubernetes** uses the Raft consensus algorithm in its etcd (distributed key-value store) to ensure consistency
 *   and fault tolerance across nodes in a Kubernetes cluster.
 * - In case of node failure or split-brain scenarios, Raft ensures that all nodes agree on the current state
 *   of the cluster, providing reliability for critical operations.
