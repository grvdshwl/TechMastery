/*
 * Virtualization:
 *
 * - Definition:
 *   Creating multiple simulated environments from a single physical hardware system using a hypervisor.
 *
 * - Key Components:
 *   - Hypervisor: Software that creates and manages VMs.
 *     - Type 1 (Bare-Metal): Runs directly on hardware (e.g., VMware ESXi).
 *     - Type 2 (Hosted): Runs on a host OS (e.g., Oracle VM VirtualBox).
 *   - Virtual Machines (VMs): Fully functional isolated OS with dedicated resources (CPU, memory, storage).
 *
 * - Characteristics:
 *   - Isolation: VMs are fully isolated from each other.
 *   - Resource Allocation: Each VM has fixed resources.
 *   - OS Overhead: Each VM includes a full OS, leading to more overhead.
 *   - Boot Time: Longer boot times compared to containers.
 *   - Portability: VMs can be moved between hardware or hypervisors.
 *
 * - Use Cases:
 *   - Running multiple operating systems on one physical machine.
 *   - Testing and development environments.
 *   - Supporting legacy applications.

/*
 * Containerization:
 *
 * - Definition:
 *   Encapsulating an application and its dependencies into a lightweight container that runs consistently across environments.
 *
 * - Key Components:
 *   - Container Engine: Software that manages containers (e.g., Docker).
 *   - Containers: Standalone executable packages including code, runtime, libraries, and dependencies.
 *
 * - Characteristics:
 *   - Isolation: Provides process-level isolation.
 *   - Resource Allocation: Shares host system resources efficiently.
 *   - OS Overhead: Containers do not include a full OS, reducing overhead.
 *   - Boot Time: Containers have significantly faster boot times.
 *   - Portability: Containers run consistently across different environments.
 *
 * - Use Cases:
 *   - Microservices architecture.
 *   - Continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines.
 *   - Application development and testing.
 *   - Simplifying deployment and scaling of applications.

/*
 * Comparison:
 *
 * - Isolation:
 *   - Virtualization: Full OS isolation (stronger isolation).
 *   - Containerization: Process-level isolation (lighter isolation).
 *
 * - Resource Usage:
 *   - Virtualization: More resource-intensive (includes full OS).
 *   - Containerization: More efficient (shares OS kernel).
 *
 * - Boot Time:
 *   - Virtualization: Slower.
 *   - Containerization: Faster.
 *
 * - Portability:
 *   - Virtualization: VM images are larger and less portable.
 *   - Containerization: Containers are smaller and highly portable.
 *
 * - Performance:
 *   - Virtualization: Some overhead due to hypervisor and full OS.
 *   - Containerization: Near-native performance.
 *
 * - Use Case:
 *   - Virtualization: Running multiple OSes, legacy apps.
 *   - Containerization: Microservices, scalable apps, CI/CD.
