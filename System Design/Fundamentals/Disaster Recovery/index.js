/**
 * Disaster Recovery
 * -----------------
 * Disaster Recovery (DR) refers to the strategies, policies, and procedures that are put in place to restore and recover
 * IT systems and operations in the event of a natural or human-made disaster (e.g., hardware failure, cyberattack, or data loss).
 * The primary goal of disaster recovery is to minimize downtime and data loss, ensuring that critical services are restored
 * quickly to maintain business continuity.
 *
 * Key Points:
 * -----------
 * 1. **RPO (Recovery Point Objective)**: Defines how much data loss is acceptable, determining how frequently data backups
 *    should be taken. E.g., an RPO of 1 hour means backups must occur at least every hour.
 * 2. **RTO (Recovery Time Objective)**: Defines how quickly services need to be restored after a disaster. E.g., an RTO of
 *    2 hours means that services must be back online within 2 hours.
 * 3. **Backup Strategies**: Regular backups of data (both incremental and full) are key to disaster recovery. These backups
 *    are typically stored in off-site locations to prevent data loss.
 * 4. **Failover**: Involves switching over to a standby server, system, or network if the primary one fails.
 * 5. **Redundancy**: Creating multiple copies of critical systems to ensure that if one fails, another can take over seamlessly.
 * 6. **Cloud-based DR**: Cloud providers offer DR solutions, such as replication across data centers, allowing rapid recovery
 *    in the event of a disaster.
 * 7. **Testing**: Regular disaster recovery tests ensure the plan works when needed. Testing identifies issues and areas
 *    for improvement.
 *
 * Types of Disaster Recovery:
 * ---------------------------
 * 1. **Backup-based Recovery**: Restoring systems and data from backups after a disaster.
 * 2. **Failover-based Recovery**: Switching to a standby system in real-time to prevent downtime.
 * 3. **Cloud DR**: Utilizing cloud services to store and recover critical data and applications.
 *
 * Use Case: Disaster Recovery for an E-commerce Platform
 * ------------------------------------------------------
 * Scenario:
 * - An e-commerce platform faces a catastrophic hardware failure that results in data loss and server downtime.
 * - The company has a disaster recovery plan that includes regular data backups and redundant cloud servers.
 *
 * Solution:
 * - Upon detecting the failure, the system automatically switches to a backup cloud server (failover) to restore services quickly.
 * - The latest data backups (stored in an off-site cloud location) are restored, minimizing data loss.
 * - The platform's downtime is limited to a few minutes, and customers can resume shopping without major disruptions.
 *
 * Example: Disaster Recovery Plan in Node.js Using Backups
 * --------------------------------------------------------
 */

const fs = require("fs");
const path = require("path");

// Backup directory path
const backupDir = path.join(__dirname, "backups");

// Function to perform backup
function performBackup() {
  // Simulate copying data to backup location
  const dataToBackup = { orders: [], customers: [] }; // Example data
  const timestamp = new Date().toISOString();
  const backupFileName = `backup-${timestamp}.json`;

  fs.writeFileSync(
    path.join(backupDir, backupFileName),
    JSON.stringify(dataToBackup)
  );
  console.log(`Backup created: ${backupFileName}`);
}

// Function to recover from a backup
function recoverFromBackup(backupFileName) {
  try {
    const backupData = fs.readFileSync(
      path.join(backupDir, backupFileName),
      "utf-8"
    );
    const recoveredData = JSON.parse(backupData);
    console.log(`Recovered data from ${backupFileName}:`, recoveredData);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error during recovery:", error.message);
  }
}

// Simulate disaster recovery process
function simulateDisasterRecovery() {
  console.log("Simulating disaster...");
  console.log("Initiating recovery process...");
  const latestBackup = fs.readdirSync(backupDir).sort().pop(); // Get the latest backup file

  if (latestBackup) {
    recoverFromBackup(latestBackup);
  } else {
    console.log("No backups available for recovery.");
  }
}

// Perform backup every hour (simulated)
setInterval(performBackup, 3600000); // 1 hour interval (in milliseconds)

// Simulate disaster and recovery after 5 seconds
setTimeout(simulateDisasterRecovery, 5000);

/**
 * Explanation:
 * ------------
 * 1. The system creates data backups at regular intervals (every hour in this case).
 * 2. If a disaster occurs (simulated after 5 seconds), the system automatically looks for the latest backup and restores data.
 * 3. This ensures that the platform can recover quickly, reducing downtime and minimizing data loss.
 *
 * User Case: Disaster Recovery in Financial Institutions
 * ------------------------------------------------------
 * Scenario:
 * - A financial institution's transaction database becomes corrupted due to a security breach.
 * - The bank needs to ensure that it can recover the data without losing transaction records.
 *
 * Solution:
 * - The financial institution has a disaster recovery plan with frequent backups and real-time replication to an off-site location.
 * - Upon detecting the corruption, the system switches to the replicated database and restores the missing data from the backup.
 * - The institution is able to recover all transactions with minimal downtime, ensuring customer trust and regulatory compliance.
 *
 * Benefits of Disaster Recovery:
 * ------------------------------
 * 1. **Business Continuity**: Ensures that critical services can continue or resume quickly after a disaster.
 * 2. **Data Protection**: Minimizes the risk of data loss, particularly in highly sensitive industries like finance and healthcare.
 * 3. **Customer Confidence**: Reduces the impact on users, maintaining trust in case of a disaster.
 * 4. **Compliance**: Many industries have legal requirements for data recovery and disaster preparedness.
 * 5. **Cost Savings**: By having a disaster recovery plan, organizations can avoid the costs associated with downtime, data loss,
 *    and lost business.
 *
 * Real-World Scenario: AWS Disaster Recovery
 * ------------------------------------------
 * - **Amazon Web Services (AWS)** offers a variety of disaster recovery solutions, including cross-region replication, automated
 *   backups, and failover strategies.
 * - With AWS, businesses can replicate their data across different regions, ensuring that even if an entire data center is
 *   affected, services can be restored from another region.
 * - AWS services like S3 (Simple Storage Service) and RDS (Relational Database Service) automatically replicate data to multiple
 *   locations, making them highly resilient to disasters.
