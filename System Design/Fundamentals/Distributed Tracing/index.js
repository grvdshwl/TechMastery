/**
 * Distributed Tracing
 * -------------------
 * Distributed tracing is a technique used to monitor and track requests as they flow through various services in
 * a distributed system or microservices architecture. It helps developers understand how requests propagate
 * across multiple services and detect performance bottlenecks or failures.
 *
 * Key Points:
 * -----------
 * 1. **Trace ID**: Each request gets a unique identifier (Trace ID) that is passed along with the request as it moves
 *    through various services. This allows the entire path of the request to be tracked.
 * 2. **Spans**: A "span" represents a single unit of work done by a particular service. Each trace is composed of multiple
 *    spans.
 * 3. **Parent-Child Relationship**: Each span has a relationship with the previous span (parent-child). This structure
 *    forms a "trace tree," where the root span represents the entry point and child spans represent work in downstream services.
 * 4. **End-to-End Visibility**: Distributed tracing provides end-to-end visibility into how a request travels through
 *    various services, capturing information like time taken by each service, error rates, and latencies.
 * 5. **Latency and Performance Analysis**: Distributed tracing helps identify where bottlenecks or slowdowns occur by showing
 *    the duration of each span.
 * 6. **Error Detection**: Traces include error logs, making it easy to detect where and why a request failed.
 * 7. **Integration with Monitoring Tools**: Distributed tracing is often integrated with monitoring and observability tools
 *    like Jaeger, Zipkin, OpenTelemetry, or Datadog to visualize and analyze traces.
 * 8. **Context Propagation**: The context (Trace ID, Span ID) is propagated through HTTP headers or other protocols to ensure
 *    that each service involved in the request processing knows which trace it belongs to.
 *
 * Use Case: Troubleshooting Latency in a Microservices Architecture
 * -----------------------------------------------------------------
 * Scenario:
 * - A large e-commerce platform uses microservices for handling various functionalities like product search, payments,
 *   inventory, and order processing.
 * - Users report that the checkout process is slow.
 *
 * Solution:
 * - By implementing distributed tracing, the development team can trace the entire checkout process from the front-end
 *   to the back-end services.
 * - The trace reveals that the payment service takes much longer than usual to respond, pointing to a potential issue in
 *   that service, like a database slowdown or network issue.
 *
 * Example: Simulating Distributed Tracing in a Node.js Application

class Tracer {
  constructor() {
    this.traces = [];
  }

  // Start a new trace with a unique trace ID
  startTrace(serviceName) {
    const traceId = `trace-${Date.now()}`;
    const span = this.startSpan(traceId, serviceName);
    this.traces.push({ traceId, spans: [span] });
    console.log(`Starting trace with Trace ID: ${traceId}`);
    return traceId;
  }

  // Start a new span for a given trace
  startSpan(traceId, serviceName) {
    const spanId = `span-${Date.now()}`;
    const startTime = new Date().getTime();
    console.log(`Span started: ${spanId} for service: ${serviceName}`);
    return { traceId, spanId, serviceName, startTime };
  }

  // End a span for a given trace
  endSpan(traceId, spanId) {
    const endTime = new Date().getTime();
    const trace = this.traces.find((t) => t.traceId === traceId);
    const span = trace.spans.find((s) => s.spanId === spanId);
    span.endTime = endTime;
    span.duration = span.endTime - span.startTime;
    console.log(`Span ended: ${spanId}, Duration: ${span.duration}ms`);
  }

  // Retrieve the trace by Trace ID
  getTrace(traceId) {
    return this.traces.find((t) => t.traceId === traceId);
  }
}

// Example usage of distributed tracing simulation

// Initialize a tracer
const tracer = new Tracer();

// Start a new trace for a checkout process (Trace for a request)
const traceId = tracer.startTrace("Checkout Service");

// Simulate spans for different services involved in the request
const paymentSpan = tracer.startSpan(traceId, "Payment Service");
setTimeout(() => {
  tracer.endSpan(traceId, paymentSpan.spanId); // End Payment Service span
}, 500); // Simulating delay of 500ms in Payment Service

const inventorySpan = tracer.startSpan(traceId, "Inventory Service");
setTimeout(() => {
  tracer.endSpan(traceId, inventorySpan.spanId); // End Inventory Service span
}, 200); // Simulating delay of 200ms in Inventory Service

// Simulate retrieving and viewing the full trace
setTimeout(() => {
  console.log("Full trace details:", tracer.getTrace(traceId));
}, 1000); // Wait for spans to finish

/**
 * Explanation:
 * ------------
 * 1. The `Tracer` class simulates distributed tracing by creating trace IDs and spans for different services.
 * 2. A trace is started with a service (e.g., "Checkout Service"), and spans are created for dependent services like
 *    "Payment Service" and "Inventory Service".
 * 3. The spans are closed after some time, recording the duration each service took to process the request.
 * 4. The full trace, including the time taken by each service, can be retrieved to identify bottlenecks.
 *
 * User Case: Distributed Tracing in a Food Delivery App
 * -----------------------------------------------------
 * Scenario:
 * - A food delivery application uses microservices for managing orders, payments, restaurant listings, and delivery tracking.
 * - Users report that placing orders is slow, but it is unclear which service is causing the delay.
 *
 * Solution:
 * - By implementing distributed tracing, the engineering team can trace user requests through various services (e.g.,
 *   "Order Service", "Restaurant Service", "Payment Gateway", "Delivery Tracking").
 * - The trace reveals that the "Payment Gateway" service takes significantly longer than other services,
 *   helping the team focus on fixing the issue.
 *
 * Benefits of Distributed Tracing:
 * --------------------------------
 * 1. **End-to-End Monitoring**: Provides visibility into how requests propagate through multiple services, enabling
 *    easier detection of performance bottlenecks and failures.
 * 2. **Improved Debugging**: With distributed tracing, developers can pinpoint which service or component is causing
 *    delays or failures.
 * 3. **Reduced Mean Time to Resolution (MTTR)**: Tracing helps quickly locate the source of the problem, reducing the
 *    time needed to resolve issues.
 * 4. **Service Dependency Insights**: Traces reveal how services depend on one another, highlighting potential points
 *    of failure in the architecture.
 * 5. **Observability**: Distributed tracing integrates well with observability tools, providing insights into system
 *    health and performance.
 *
 * Real-World Scenario: Uber's Distributed Tracing
 * -----------------------------------------------
 * - **Uber** uses distributed tracing to track requests as they move through its microservices architecture.
 * - When users experience slow ride bookings, distributed traces reveal whether the issue lies with the driver location
 *   service, pricing service, or payment processing, enabling faster resolution of issues.
