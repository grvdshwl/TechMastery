/**
 * Event-Driven Architectures (EDA) vs. Workflows
 *
 * Event-Driven Architectures (EDA):
 * - **Concept**: React to events (changes in state or actions) asynchronously.
 * - **Components**:
 *   - Events: Triggers that indicate a change or action.
 *   - Event Producers: Generate events.
 *   - Event Consumers: React to events.
 *   - Event Bus/Stream: Transmits events.
 * - **Characteristics**:
 *   - Loose Coupling: Producers and consumers are decoupled.
 *   - Asynchronous: Events are processed without waiting.
 *   - Scalability: Easily handles high loads.
 * - **Real-Life Example**:
 *   - **E-commerce Platform**: When a user places an order, an event is triggered.
 *     This event can be consumed by various services, such as inventory management
 *     to update stock, payment processing to charge the customer, and order tracking
 *     to update the order status, all without directly depending on each other.
 *
 * Workflows:
 * - **Concept**: Sequence of predefined steps to achieve a specific outcome.
 * - **Components**:
 *   - Tasks: Discrete actions or steps.
 *   - Transitions: Rules that guide flow between tasks.
 *   - Workflow Engine: Manages and coordinates tasks.
 * - **Characteristics**:
 *   - Orchestrated Flow: Predefined sequence of steps.
 *   - State Management: Tracks progress and state of tasks.
 *   - Error Handling: Manages retries and errors in tasks.
 * - **Real-Life Example**:
 *   - **Employee Onboarding**: A workflow system guides the process of onboarding a
 *     new employee. This includes tasks like document submission, account setup,
 *     training sessions, and access provisioning. The workflow ensures each step is
 *     completed in the correct order and that progress is tracked and managed.
 *
 * Key Differences:
 * - **Control Flow**:
 *   - EDA: Decentralized and event-driven.
 *   - Workflows: Centralized and structured.
 * - **Flexibility vs. Structure**:
 *   - EDA: Flexible, adaptable to changes.
 *   - Workflows: Structured, repeatable.
 * - **Scalability**:
 *   - EDA: High scalability due to asynchronous processing.
 *   - Workflows: Dependent on workflow engine capabilities.
 *
 * Both EDA and workflows can be integrated for complex systems where both
 * dynamic event handling and structured processes are needed.
