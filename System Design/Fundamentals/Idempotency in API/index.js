/**
 * API Idempotency
 *
 * Idempotency refers to the property of an API operation where the
 * outcome remains the same no matter how many times the operation is
 * performed with the same input. This means that making the same request
 * multiple times will not have different effects after the initial execution.
 *
 * Why is Idempotency Important?
 * - Consistency: Ensures that repeated operations yield the same result.
 * - Safety: Prevents accidental duplication, such as in financial transactions.
 * - Error Handling: Helps manage retries due to network issues without causing
 *   duplicate actions.
 * - User Experience: Avoids issues like duplicate charges or records.
 * - System Stability: Makes the system more predictable and stable.
 *
 * How is Idempotency Implemented?
 * - Idempotency Keys: Unique identifiers sent with requests to track
 *   and manage repeated operations.
 * - HTTP Methods: Methods like GET, PUT, and DELETE are generally
 *   idempotent, ensuring consistent behavior across requests.
