/**
 * Load Balancing:
 *
 * Load balancing is the process of distributing network or application traffic across
 * multiple servers to ensure no single server becomes overwhelmed. This helps in improving
 * the responsiveness and availability of applications, websites, and services.
 *
 * How Load Balancing Works:
 *
 * 1. Traffic Distribution:
 *    - Incoming client requests are distributed across multiple servers based on a
 *      specific algorithm.
 *    - Common algorithms include round-robin, least connections, and IP hash.
 *
 * 2. Load Balancer Types:
 *    - Hardware Load Balancers: Physical devices dedicated to load balancing.
 *    - Software Load Balancers: Software applications that can be run on standard servers.
 *    - Cloud-based Load Balancers: Load balancing services provided by cloud platforms
 *      (e.g., AWS ELB, Google Cloud Load Balancing).
 *
 * 3. Load Balancing Algorithms:
 *    - Round Robin: Distributes requests sequentially across the servers.
 *    - Least Connections: Sends requests to the server with the fewest active connections.
 *    - IP Hash: Distributes requests based on a hash of the client's IP address.
 *    - Weighted Round Robin: Servers are assigned different weights, and requests are
 *      distributed based on these weights.
 *
 * 4. Health Checks:
 *    - Load balancers perform regular health checks on servers to ensure they are
 *      capable of handling requests.
 *    - If a server is detected to be down or unhealthy, the load balancer stops
 *      sending traffic to that server until it recovers.
 *
 * Advantages of Load Balancing:
 *
 * 1. Improved Availability:
 *    - Ensures high availability by distributing traffic across multiple servers.
 *    - If one server fails, the load balancer redirects traffic to other healthy servers.
 *
 * 2. Enhanced Performance:
 *    - Distributes workload evenly, preventing any single server from becoming a
 *      bottleneck.
 *    - Improves response times and overall user experience.
 *
 * 3. Scalability:
 *    - Easily scales the application by adding more servers to handle increased traffic.
 *    - Supports both vertical and horizontal scaling.
 *
 * 4. Redundancy:
 *    - Provides redundancy by using multiple servers, which helps in maintaining
 *      service continuity.
 *
 * 5. Maintenance Without Downtime:
 *    - Allows for server maintenance and updates without downtime by redirecting
 *      traffic to other servers during maintenance.
 *
 * 6. Security:
 *    - Some load balancers provide additional security features such as SSL termination,
 *      protection against DDoS attacks, and application firewalling.
 *
 * Example Scenario:
 *
 * - A popular e-commerce website uses a load balancer to distribute incoming traffic
 *   across a cluster of web servers. This ensures that the website remains responsive
 *   and available even during peak shopping times, such as Black Friday.
 * - The load balancer performs health checks on the servers. If one server goes down,
 *   the load balancer automatically routes traffic to the remaining healthy servers,
 *   ensuring continuous service availability.
