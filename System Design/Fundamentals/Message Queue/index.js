/*
 * Message Queue:
 *
 * - Definition:
 *   A message queue is a form of asynchronous service-to-service communication used in serverless and microservices architectures.
 *   It allows components to communicate and process operations without requiring them to be connected simultaneously.
 *
 * - Key Concepts:
 *   - Message: The data being transferred between components. It can be in various formats, such as JSON, XML, or plain text.
 *   - Queue: A data structure that stores messages in the order they were sent until they are processed by a receiving component.
 *   - Producers: Components or services that send messages to the queue.
 *   - Consumers: Components or services that receive and process messages from the queue.
 *
 * - Characteristics:
 *   - Asynchronous: Producers and consumers operate independently, which means they do not need to interact with the queue at the same time.
 *   - Decoupling: Producers and consumers are decoupled, which increases system flexibility and scalability.
 *   - Durability: Messages are stored in the queue until they are processed, ensuring that no messages are lost.
 *   - Scalability: Multiple consumers can process messages from the same queue, allowing the system to scale horizontally.
 *   - Reliability: The message queue ensures that messages are delivered and processed even if the producer or consumer is temporarily unavailable.
 *
 * - Components:
 *   - Message Broker: The system or service that implements the message queue and manages the storage, delivery, and acknowledgment of messages.
 *     Examples include RabbitMQ, Apache Kafka, Amazon SQS, and Google Cloud Pub/Sub.
 *   - Message: The actual content that is sent from a producer to a consumer through the message queue.
 *   - Producer: The entity that sends messages to the message queue.
 *   - Consumer: The entity that retrieves and processes messages from the message queue.
 *
 * - Use Cases:
 *   - Decoupling Microservices: Enabling independent scaling and deployment of microservices.
 *   - Load Balancing: Distributing workload evenly across multiple consumers.
 *   - Asynchronous Processing: Handling tasks that do not need to be processed immediately, such as background jobs or scheduled tasks.
 *   - Event-Driven Architectures: Triggering actions based on events, such as user activity or system state changes.
 *   - Data Streaming: Managing and processing streams of data in real-time.
 *
 * - Example Flow:
 *   1. A producer sends a message to the message queue.
 *   2. The message broker stores the message in the queue.
 *   3. A consumer retrieves the message from the queue.
 *   4. The consumer processes the message and acknowledges its completion.
 *   5. The message broker removes the message from the queue once it has been processed.
 *
 * - Example Implementation (Pseudo Code):
 *
 *   // Producer sends a message to the queue
 *   messageQueue.sendMessage("orderQueue", { orderId: 12345, product: "Laptop", quantity: 1 });
 *
 *   // Consumer retrieves and processes messages from the queue
 *   messageQueue.consumeMessages("orderQueue", (message) => {
 *     const order = message.content;
 *     processOrder(order);
 *     message.acknowledge(); // Acknowledge that the message has been processed
 *   });
