/*
 * Monolith vs Microservices Architecture:
 *
 * - Monolith Architecture:
 *
 *   - Definition:
 *     A monolithic architecture is a traditional model for designing software applications where all components and functions are interconnected and interdependent.
 *     The entire application is built as a single, cohesive unit.
 *
 *   - Characteristics:
 *     - Single Codebase: All components and modules are part of one codebase.
 *     - Single Deployment: The application is deployed as a single unit.
 *     - Tight Coupling: Components are tightly coupled, making changes and scaling challenging.
 *     - Shared Database: Typically uses a single database for the entire application.
 *     - Simple Development: Easier to develop initially, as everything is in one place.
 *
 *   - Advantages:
 *     - Simplicity: Easier to develop and test initially.
 *     - Performance: No overhead of inter-service communication.
 *     - Deployment: Simple deployment process.
 *     - Debugging: Easier to debug as everything is in one place.
 *
 *   - Disadvantages:
 *     - Scalability: Harder to scale parts of the application independently.
 *     - Flexibility: Difficult to adopt new technologies incrementally.
 *     - Maintenance: More challenging to maintain as the codebase grows.
 *     - Development Speed: Slower development and deployment cycles.
 *
 *   - Use Cases:
 *     - Small, simple applications.
 *     - Early-stage startups or projects with a small team.
 *     - Applications that require tight integration of components.

/*
 * - Microservices Architecture:
 *
 *   - Definition:
 *     A microservices architecture is an approach where an application is composed of small, independent services that communicate over well-defined APIs.
 *     Each service is responsible for a specific business function and can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently.
 *
 *   - Characteristics:
 *     - Independent Services: Each service is a separate codebase and can be developed and deployed independently.
 *     - Decoupling: Services are loosely coupled, enhancing flexibility and maintainability.
 *     - Independent Deployment: Services can be deployed independently, allowing for continuous delivery and deployment.
 *     - Polyglot Persistence: Each service can use its own database and technology stack.
 *     - Scalability: Services can be scaled independently based on demand.
 *
 *   - Advantages:
 *     - Scalability: Easier to scale individual services.
 *     - Flexibility: Allows the use of different technologies for different services.
 *     - Resilience: Failure in one service does not affect the entire application.
 *     - Faster Development: Teams can work on different services in parallel.
 *     - Continuous Deployment: Enables frequent and independent releases.
 *
 *   - Disadvantages:
 *     - Complexity: More complex to develop and manage.
 *     - Inter-Service Communication: Introduces overhead of managing inter-service communication.
 *     - Deployment: More complex deployment process.
 *     - Debugging: More challenging to debug issues that span multiple services.
 *     - Data Consistency: Managing data consistency across services can be challenging.
 *
 *   - Use Cases:
 *     - Large, complex applications.
 *     - Applications requiring high scalability and availability.
 *     - Organizations with large, distributed development teams.
 *     - Applications with diverse and evolving technology stacks.

 *     saveOrderToDatabase(order);
 *     notifyUser(order);

 *     validateOrder(order);
 *     saveOrderToDatabase(order);
 *     sendMessageToQueue("notificationQueue", { orderId: order.id });

 *   // Notification Service
 *   function handleNotification(message) {
 *     const order = getOrderFromDatabase(message.orderId);
 *     notifyUser(order);
