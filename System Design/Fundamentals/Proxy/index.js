/**
 * Forward Proxy vs Reverse Proxy:
 *
 * Proxies are intermediaries that sit between clients and servers, forwarding requests
 * and responses. There are two main types: forward proxies and reverse proxies.
 *
 * 1. Forward Proxy:
 *    - Definition: A forward proxy is an intermediary server that sits between a client
 *      and the internet. It forwards client requests to external servers and returns the
 *      responses from those servers back to the clients.
 *    - Use Case: Typically used to provide anonymity, security, and access control for
 *      clients.
 *    - How It Works:
 *      - The client sends a request to the forward proxy.
 *      - The forward proxy forwards the request to the target server on behalf of the client.
 *      - The target server processes the request and sends the response back to the forward proxy.
 *      - The forward proxy then returns the response to the client.
 *    - Pros:
 *      - Anonymity: Hides the client's IP address from the target server.
 *      - Access Control: Can restrict or allow access to certain websites or content.
 *      - Caching: Can cache responses from servers to improve load times and reduce bandwidth usage.
 *    - Cons:
 *      - Performance: Adds an extra hop in the network path, which can introduce latency.
 *    - Example: A company using a forward proxy to filter and monitor employee internet usage.
 *
 * 2. Reverse Proxy:
 *    - Definition: A reverse proxy is an intermediary server that sits between external
 *      clients and internal servers. It forwards client requests to the appropriate backend
 *      server and returns the server's response to the clients.
 *    - Use Case: Typically used to provide load balancing, security, and caching for servers.
 *    - How It Works:
 *      - The client sends a request to the reverse proxy.
 *      - The reverse proxy determines which backend server should handle the request and
 *        forwards it to that server.
 *      - The backend server processes the request and sends the response back to the reverse proxy.
 *      - The reverse proxy then returns the response to the client.
 *    - Pros:
 *      - Load Balancing: Distributes incoming requests across multiple backend servers to
 *        balance the load and improve performance.
 *      - Security: Can hide the internal server details from clients and provide additional
 *        security features like SSL termination and DDoS protection.
 *      - Caching: Can cache responses to improve response times and reduce load on backend servers.
 *      - SSL Termination: Can handle SSL encryption and decryption, offloading this work from
 *        backend servers.
 *    - Cons:
 *      - Complexity: Adds an additional layer of infrastructure that needs to be managed.
 *    - Example: A website using a reverse proxy to distribute incoming traffic across several
 *      web servers to ensure high availability and performance.
 *
 * Summary:
 * - Forward Proxy:
 *   - Sits between client and internet.
 *   - Used for client anonymity, security, and access control.
 *   - Examples: Web proxy servers, content filtering.
 *
 * - Reverse Proxy:
 *   - Sits between internet and servers.
 *   - Used for load balancing, security, and caching.
 *   - Examples: Load balancers, web accelerators.
 *
 * Example Scenarios:
 * - Forward Proxy:
 *   - A user in a corporate network uses a forward proxy to access blocked websites.
 *   - A user wants to hide their IP address while browsing the internet.
 *
 * - Reverse Proxy:
 *   - An e-commerce website uses a reverse proxy to distribute incoming traffic among multiple
 *     backend servers to ensure the site remains responsive even during peak times.
 *   - A content delivery network (CDN) uses reverse proxies to cache and serve content closer
 *     to the user's location, reducing latency and improving load times.
