// Rate Limiting in JavaScript

// Rate limiting is a technique used to control the number of requests 
// a user or client can make to a server within a specific time period. 
// This helps prevent abuse, manage resources, and ensure fair usage of the system.

// Why Rate Limiting is Needed:
// 1. Preventing Abuse: Stops excessive or malicious requests that could overload the system.
// 2. Resource Management: Ensures efficient use of server resources.
// 3. Fair Usage: Allows all users to have equitable access to the service.
// 4. Cost Control: Helps in managing and limiting costs associated with usage-based billing.
// 5. System Stability: Maintains the stability and performance of the system by preventing traffic spikes.

// Techniques for Rate Limiting:
// 1. Token Bucket: Requests are allowed as long as tokens are available in a bucket, 
//    which refills at a steady rate.
// 2. Leaky Bucket: Similar to Token Bucket but processes requests at a constant rate, 
//    dropping excess requests if they arrive too quickly.
// 3. Fixed Window: A simple method allowing a fixed number of requests per fixed time window, 
//    but can lead to uneven traffic spikes.
// 4. Sliding Window: An improved method over Fixed Window, with a window that slides over time, 
//    smoothing out the request rate.



// Implications of Rate Limiting:
// - User Experience: If not communicated well, rate limiting can frustrate users. 
//   It's important to provide feedback and suggest retry strategies.
// - System Design: Requires careful planning to implement correctly, 
//   including handling edge cases and exceptions.
// - Legal and Compliance: Sometimes necessary to comply with legal requirements or contracts.
// - Performance Overhead: Checking and enforcing rate limits adds some overhead, 
//   which should be managed efficiently.
