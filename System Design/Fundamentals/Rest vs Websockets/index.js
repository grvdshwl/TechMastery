/**
 * REST vs WebSockets:
 *
 * REST (Representational State Transfer) and WebSockets are two different approaches for
 * communication between clients and servers. They are designed to serve different purposes
 * and are suitable for different types of applications.
 *
 * REST (Representational State Transfer):
 *
 * 1. Definition:
 *    - REST is an architectural style for designing networked applications, relying on a
 *      stateless, client-server, cacheable communication protocol, typically HTTP.
 *
 * 2. How It Works:
 *    - Client sends an HTTP request (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) to a RESTful web service.
 *    - Server processes the request and sends back an HTTP response, usually in JSON or XML format.
 *
 * 3. Characteristics:
 *    - Stateless: Each request from client to server must contain all the information the
 *      server needs to fulfill that request.
 *    - Resource-Based: Everything is treated as a resource, identified by a URI.
 *    - Standard HTTP Methods: Uses standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.).
 *    - CRUD Operations: Typically used to perform Create, Read, Update, Delete operations on resources.
 *
 * 4. Use Cases:
 *    - Web APIs for interacting with web services.
 *    - CRUD operations for applications (e.g., managing user data, fetching product details).
 *    - Interacting with microservices.
 *
 * 5. Advantages:
 *    - Simplicity: Easy to use and widely supported.
 *    - Scalability: Stateless nature makes it easy to scale horizontally.
 *    - Caching: HTTP responses can be cached to improve performance.
 *    - Interoperability: Works well with existing web infrastructure.
 *
 * 6. Disadvantages:
 *    - Latency: Each request requires a new HTTP connection, which can introduce latency.
 *    - Overhead: HTTP headers add to the data transmitted.
 *    - No Real-Time Communication: Not suitable for real-time applications.
 *
 * WebSockets:
 *
 * 1. Definition:
 *    - WebSockets is a communication protocol that provides full-duplex communication channels
 *      over a single, long-lived TCP connection, enabling real-time interaction between client
 *      and server.
 *
 * 2. How It Works:
 *    - Client initiates a WebSocket handshake by sending an HTTP request.
 *    - Server responds and, if successful, the connection is upgraded to a WebSocket connection.
 *    - Both client and server can send and receive messages simultaneously over the same connection.
 *
 * 3. Characteristics:
 *    - Full-Duplex: Allows for simultaneous two-way communication.
 *    - Persistent Connection: The connection remains open, reducing the overhead of establishing
 *      new connections.
 *    - Real-Time Communication: Suitable for applications requiring instant data exchange.
 *    - Binary and Text Data: Supports both binary and text data frames.
 *
 * 4. Use Cases:
 *    - Real-time applications (e.g., chat applications, live sports updates).
 *    - Online gaming.
 *    - Collaborative tools (e.g., live document editing).
 *    - Financial tickers and real-time trading platforms.
 *
 * 5. Advantages:
 *    - Low Latency: Persistent connection minimizes the delay between message exchanges.
 *    - Efficiency: Reduced overhead compared to HTTP since headers are sent only once during
 *      the handshake.
 *    - Real-Time: Suitable for applications needing real-time updates.
 *
 * 6. Disadvantages:
 *    - Complexity: More complex to implement and manage compared to REST.
 *    - Scalability: Maintaining open connections can be challenging for large-scale applications.
 *    - Not Cacheable: WebSocket messages are not cacheable, which can affect performance.
 *
 * Summary:
 * - REST is ideal for applications where stateless communication and standard HTTP methods
 *   suffice, such as CRUD operations and web APIs.
 * - WebSockets are better suited for applications requiring real-time, low-latency, full-duplex
 *   communication, such as chat applications, live updates, and online gaming.
 *
 * Example Scenarios:
 * - REST: A client application fetches user data from a RESTful API using an HTTP GET request,
 *   updates user details with an HTTP PUT request, and deletes user records with an HTTP DELETE request.
 * - WebSockets: A live chat application uses WebSockets to maintain an open connection between
 *   the client and server, allowing for instant message exchanges and real-time updates.
