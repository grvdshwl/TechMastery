/**
 * SQL vs NoSQL Databases:
 *
 * SQL (Structured Query Language) Databases:
 * - SQL databases are relational databases that use structured query language (SQL)
 *   for defining and manipulating data.
 * - They have a predefined schema, which means the structure of the data (tables,
 *   columns, data types, etc.) is defined beforehand.
 * - SQL databases are ACID compliant (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability),
 *   ensuring reliable transactions and data integrity.
 * - Examples: MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server.
 *
 * Pros of SQL Databases:
 * 1. Structured Data: Ideal for structured data with relationships (e.g., tables with
 *    foreign keys).
 * 2. ACID Compliance: Ensures reliable transactions and data consistency.
 * 3. Powerful Query Language: SQL is a powerful and flexible language for querying
 *    and manipulating data.
 * 4. Standardization: SQL is a standardized language, making it easier to find
 *    developers and resources.
 *
 * Cons of SQL Databases:
 * 1. Scalability: Vertical scaling (adding more power to a single server) can be
 *    expensive and has limits. Horizontal scaling (adding more servers) is complex.
 * 2. Fixed Schema: Changes to the schema can be difficult and require careful planning.
 *
 * Use Case Scenarios for SQL Databases:
 * 1. Banking Systems: Requires complex queries and transactions with high data integrity.
 * 2. E-commerce Applications: Need structured data with relationships (e.g., orders,
 *    customers, products).
 * 3. Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP): Complex systems with multiple related entities.
 *
 * NoSQL (Not Only SQL) Databases:
 * - NoSQL databases are non-relational databases designed for flexibility and scalability.
 * - They do not require a fixed schema, allowing for dynamic and unstructured data.
 * - They can be classified into various types: document stores, key-value stores,
 *   column-family stores, and graph databases.
 * - Examples: MongoDB (document store), Redis (key-value store), Cassandra (column-family
 *   store), Neo4j (graph database).
 *
 * Pros of NoSQL Databases:
 * 1. Scalability: Easily scalable horizontally by adding more servers.
 * 2. Flexible Schema: Allows for unstructured and semi-structured data, enabling rapid
 *    iteration and changes.
 * 3. Performance: Optimized for specific data models and access patterns, providing high
 *    performance for certain use cases.
 * 4. Big Data: Capable of handling large volumes of data with high throughput.
 *
 * Cons of NoSQL Databases:
 * 1. Lack of Standardization: NoSQL databases use different query languages and APIs,
 *    making it harder to switch between them.
 * 2. Limited ACID Compliance: Many NoSQL databases prioritize scalability and performance
 *    over strict ACID compliance, leading to potential data consistency issues.
 * 3. Learning Curve: Developers need to learn different paradigms and query languages.
 *
 * Use Case Scenarios for NoSQL Databases:
 * 1. Real-Time Analytics: High-speed data ingestion and retrieval for real-time analytics
 *    (e.g., log analysis, IoT data).
 * 2. Content Management Systems: Flexible schema for storing diverse content types
 *    (e.g., articles, images, metadata).
 * 3. Social Networks: Handling large volumes of user-generated content with varying
 *    structures (e.g., posts, comments, likes).
 * 4. Gaming Applications: High performance and scalability for storing game states and
 *    user data.
