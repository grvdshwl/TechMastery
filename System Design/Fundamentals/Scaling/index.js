 * Vertical Scaling vs Horizontal Scaling:
 *
 * Scaling is the process of increasing or decreasing the capacity of a system to handle an
 * increased or decreased amount of workload. There are two primary methods of scaling:
 * vertical scaling and horizontal scaling.
 *
 * 1. Vertical Scaling (Scaling Up):
 *    - Definition: Vertical scaling involves adding more power (CPU, RAM, storage) to an
 *      existing server to handle an increased load.
 *    - How It Works:
 *      - Upgrading the hardware of the existing server, such as adding more RAM, a faster CPU,
 *        or larger hard drives.
 *      - This makes the single server more powerful and capable of handling more tasks.
 *    - Pros:
 *      - Simplicity: Easier to implement since it involves upgrading a single server.
 *      - No Code Changes: Typically does not require changes to the application code.
 *      - Consistency: All data and processes are on one machine, making management straightforward.
 *    - Cons:
 *      - Limits: There's a physical limit to how much you can upgrade a single server (hardware
 *        limitations).
 *      - Downtime: Upgrading hardware might require downtime.
 *      - Cost: High-end hardware can be expensive.
 *    - Example: Upgrading a database server from 32GB to 64GB of RAM to handle more queries.
 *
 * 2. Horizontal Scaling (Scaling Out):
 *    - Definition: Horizontal scaling involves adding more servers to a system to handle an
 *      increased load. This means distributing the workload across multiple machines.
 *    - How It Works:
 *      - Adding more servers or instances to the system, and distributing the workload among them.
 *      - Often involves load balancing to distribute incoming requests evenly across the servers.
 *    - Pros:
 *      - Scalability: Easier to scale out by adding more servers as needed, with no fixed limit.
 *      - Fault Tolerance: If one server fails, others can continue to handle the load, improving
 *        availability and reliability.
 *      - Cost-Effective: Can use multiple low-cost servers instead of one high-cost server.
 *    - Cons:
 *      - Complexity: More complex to implement and manage due to the need for load balancing,
 *        data synchronization, and distributed computing.
 *      - Code Changes: Applications may need to be designed or refactored to work in a distributed
 *        environment.
 *      - Consistency: Ensuring data consistency across multiple servers can be challenging.
 *    - Example: Adding more web servers to a cluster behind a load balancer to handle increased
 *      web traffic.
 *
 * Summary:
 * - Vertical Scaling (Scaling Up):
 *   - Adds resources to a single server.
 *   - Easier to implement but has physical and cost limits.
 *   - Example: Upgrading server hardware.
 *
 * - Horizontal Scaling (Scaling Out):
 *   - Adds more servers to distribute the load.
 *   - More complex but offers greater scalability and fault tolerance.
 *   - Example: Adding more servers behind a load balancer.
 *
 * Example Scenarios:
 * - Vertical Scaling:
 *   - A small e-commerce website initially runs on a single server. As traffic increases, the
 *     server is upgraded with more RAM and a faster CPU to handle more visitors and transactions.
 *
 * - Horizontal Scaling:
 *   - A social media platform experiences rapid growth. To handle the increased user base and
 *     activity, the platform adds multiple application servers and database replicas, distributing
 *     the load with load balancers and ensuring high availability and performance.
