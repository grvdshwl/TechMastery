System Design Overview

Components:

    User Database:
        - Stores user information such as username, passwordHash, email, etc.
        - Handles user registration and retrieval of user data.

    Authentication Service:
        - Manages the login and registration process.
        - Verifies user credentials (e.g., password verification).
        - Generates and validates authentication tokens (e.g., JWT).

    Password Manager:
        - Handles password hashing and verification.
        - Uses algorithms like bcrypt to securely hash passwords.

    Token Manager:
        - Generates tokens upon successful authentication.
        - Validates and refreshes tokens.

    Session Manager (Optional):
        - Manages user sessions if using session-based authentication.
        - Stores session data in-memory or in a database.

    Access Control:
        - Controls access to resources based on authentication status.
        - Enforces roles and permissions if needed.

Interactions:

    User Registration:
        - User provides a username and password.
        - The system hashes the password and stores the user data in the database.

    User Login:
        - User provides credentials (username and password).
        - The system verifies the password and generates an authentication token if successful.

    Token Validation:
        - The system checks the validity of the token before granting access to protected resources.

    Access Control:
        - Users can access resources based on their authentication status.
