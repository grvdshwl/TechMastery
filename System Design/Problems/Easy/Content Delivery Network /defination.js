/**
 * A Content Delivery Network (CDN) is a system of distributed servers that work together to
 * deliver web content and services to users efficiently. The primary goal of a CDN is to reduce
 * latency, improve load times, and enhance the overall performance of web applications by
 * serving content from geographically closer servers.
 *
 * Key Characteristics:
 * - **Distributed Servers**: A CDN consists of multiple servers located in different geographic
 *   locations, known as edge servers or nodes.
 * - **Caching**: Caches static and dynamic content at edge servers to reduce the load on the
 *   origin server and minimize the distance data must travel.
 * - **Load Balancing**: Distributes user requests across multiple servers to ensure efficient
 *   resource utilization and high availability.
 * - **Fault Tolerance**: Provides redundancy and failover mechanisms to maintain service availability
 *   in case of server failures or network issues.
 *
 * How It Works:
 * - **Content Replication**: Replicates content from the origin server to edge servers. When a user
 *   requests content, the CDN serves it from the nearest edge server, reducing latency and improving
 *   load times.
 *
 * - **Request Routing**: Uses algorithms to route user requests to the most appropriate edge server
 *   based on factors like proximity, server load, and network conditions.
 *
 * - **Caching Mechanism**: Stores frequently accessed content in the cache of edge servers. Updates
 *   or invalidates cached content based on policies and cache expiration rules.
 *
 * - **Content Delivery**: Delivers content such as web pages, images, videos, and scripts to users
 *   quickly and efficiently by leveraging the distributed nature of the CDN.
 *
 * - **Operations**:
 *   - **Cache Invalidation**: Removes or updates cached content when changes occur on the origin
 *     server.
 *   - **Content Purge**: Clears outdated or unnecessary content from edge servers.
 *   - **Performance Monitoring**: Monitors CDN performance, such as response times and cache hit ratios.
 *
 * Example Use Case:
 * - **Web Performance**: Enhancing the speed and reliability of delivering web pages and multimedia
 *   content to users globally.
 * - **Video Streaming**: Streaming video content with minimal buffering and high-quality playback.
 * - **Software Distribution**: Distributing software updates or files to users efficiently and reliably.
