/**
 * A Distributed Cache is a system that stores and manages cached data across multiple nodes
 * or servers in a distributed environment. It is designed to improve data access speed and
 * scalability by distributing cached data and handling large volumes of requests efficiently.
 *
 * Key Characteristics:
 * - **Distributed Storage**: Data is stored across multiple cache nodes or servers, allowing for
 *   scalable and fault-tolerant caching.
 * - **Cache Replication**: Optionally replicates cached data across nodes to enhance reliability
 *   and availability.
 * - **Load Balancing**: Distributes cache requests among different nodes to balance the load and
 *   avoid bottlenecks.
 * - **Scalability**: Can scale horizontally by adding more cache nodes to handle increased load and
 *   data volume.
 *
 * How It Works:
 * - **Data Distribution**: Uses algorithms, such as consistent hashing or partitioning, to distribute
 *   cached data across different nodes. This ensures even load distribution and efficient data retrieval.
 *
 * - **Caching Mechanism**: Stores frequently accessed data in memory to reduce the need for repeated
 *   retrieval from slower backend systems, such as databases or file systems.
 *
 * - **Replication and Fault Tolerance**: Optionally replicates cached data across multiple nodes to
 *   ensure data availability in case of node failures.
 *
 * - **Cache Invalidation**: Implements strategies to handle cache updates or invalidation, such as
 *   time-based expiration or explicit invalidation on data changes.
 *
 * - **Operations**:
 *   - **Put**: Inserts or updates data in the cache.
 *   - **Get**: Retrieves data from the cache.
 *   - **Invalidate**: Removes or updates cached data based on expiration or other criteria.
 *   - **Monitor**: Tracks cache performance metrics, such as hit/miss ratios and latency.
 *
 * Example Use Case:
 * - **Web Applications**: Accelerating response times for frequently accessed data, such as user sessions
 *   or query results.
 * - **Database Caching**: Reducing the load on databases by caching query results or frequently accessed
 *   records.
 * - **Distributed Systems**: Enhancing performance and scalability of distributed applications by caching
 *   intermediate data or results.
