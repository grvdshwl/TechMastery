/**
 * A Distributed Job Scheduler is a system that manages and coordinates the execution of jobs
 * (tasks, processes) across multiple nodes or servers in a distributed environment. It ensures
 * that jobs are executed in a timely manner, even in the presence of failures or varying loads.
 *
 * Key Characteristics:
 * - **Job Scheduling**: Assigns and manages jobs to be executed on different nodes or servers
 *   based on various criteria like priority, resource availability, and job dependencies.
 * - **Distribution**: Distributes job execution across multiple nodes to balance the load and
 *   increase reliability.
 * - **Fault Tolerance**: Handles node failures by reassigning jobs or retrying failed jobs to
 *   ensure job completion.
 * - **Scalability**: Can scale horizontally by adding more nodes to handle increased job volume
 *   and complexity.
 *
 * How It Works:
 * - **Job Queuing**: Uses job queues to manage and prioritize jobs awaiting execution. Jobs are
 *   added to the queue and processed based on their priority and scheduling policies.
 *
 * - **Load Balancing**: Distributes jobs across available nodes to ensure even workload and efficient
 *   resource utilization.
 *
 * - **Fault Tolerance**: Monitors job execution and node health. If a node fails, the scheduler
 *   reassigns jobs to other nodes or retries failed jobs to maintain job completion.
 *
 * - **Scheduling Policies**: Implements various scheduling policies such as round-robin, priority-based,
 *   or time-based scheduling to determine job execution order.
 *
 * - **Operations**:
 *   - **Submit Job**: Adds a new job to the job queue for execution.
 *   - **Monitor Job**: Tracks the status and progress of jobs being executed.
 *   - **Retry Job**: Re-attempts execution of failed jobs.
 *   - **Cancel Job**: Removes a job from the queue or stops its execution.
 *
 * Example Use Case:
 * - **Distributed Computing**: Managing and scheduling compute tasks across a cluster of servers.
 * - **Data Processing**: Orchestrating large-scale data processing tasks in a distributed environment.
 * - **Batch Processing**: Coordinating and executing batch jobs in data pipelines or ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes.
