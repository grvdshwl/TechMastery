/**
 * A Distributed Key-Value Store is a system that stores and manages key-value pairs across
 * multiple nodes or servers, ensuring data is distributed and accessible even in the presence
 * of failures. It is designed to handle large volumes of data and provide high availability
 * and fault tolerance.
 *
 * Key Characteristics:
 * - **Key-Value Storage**: Stores data as key-value pairs, where each key is unique and maps
 *   to a value.
 * - **Distribution**: Distributes data across multiple nodes to balance load and increase
 *   reliability.
 * - **Scalability**: Can scale horizontally by adding more nodes to handle increased load and
 *   data volume.
 * - **Fault Tolerance**: Ensures data availability and consistency even if some nodes fail.
 *
 * How It Works:
 * - **Data Distribution**: Uses algorithms like consistent hashing to distribute keys across
 *   different nodes. This helps balance the load and allows for efficient data retrieval.
 *
 * - **Replication**: Often replicates data across multiple nodes to ensure durability and
 *   availability. If one node fails, the data can be retrieved from another node.
 *
 * - **Partitioning**: Splits data into partitions or shards, each managed by a different node.
 *   This allows for parallel processing and efficient data management.
 *
 * - **Consistency Models**: Implements consistency models such as eventual consistency or strong
 *   consistency to manage how data is synchronized across nodes.
 *
 * - **Operations**:
 *   - **Put**: Inserts or updates a key-value pair in the store.
 *   - **Get**: Retrieves the value associated with a given key.
 *   - **Delete**: Removes a key-value pair from the store.
 *   - **Query**: Allows searching or querying data based on specific criteria.
 *
 * Example Use Case:
 * - **Web Applications**: Storing session data or user profiles across a distributed system.
 * - **E-commerce**: Managing product catalogs and customer information in a scalable manner.
 * - **Big Data**: Handling large datasets and providing fast access in distributed environments.
