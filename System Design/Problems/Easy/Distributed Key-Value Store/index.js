// Key-Value Store System Design

// 1. **Data Partitioning:**
//    - **Sharding:** Distribute data across multiple nodes by dividing the keyspace into shards.
//    - **Consistent Hashing:** Use consistent hashing to map keys to specific shards, ensuring even distribution and easy scalability.
//    - **Replication:** Replicate each shard across multiple nodes for high availability and fault tolerance.

// 2. **Data Storage:**
//    - **In-Memory Storage:** Store key-value pairs in memory for fast access (e.g., Redis).
//    - **Persistent Storage:** Store data on disk for durability (e.g., RocksDB, LevelDB).
//    - **Hybrid Approach:** Use both in-memory and persistent storage for optimal performance and durability.

// 3. **Data Consistency:**
//    - **Eventual Consistency:** Allow temporary inconsistency with eventual convergence (e.g., in distributed systems).
//    - **Strong Consistency:** Ensure all reads and writes see the latest data, using techniques like Paxos or Raft for consensus.
//    - **Quorum-Based Consistency:** Use read and write quorums to balance consistency and availability.

// 4. **Caching:**
//    - **Cache Layer:** Implement an in-memory cache to reduce read latency for frequently accessed data.
//    - **Cache Invalidation:** Use policies like LRU (Least Recently Used) or TTL (Time-To-Live) for cache eviction.
//    - **Write-Through/Write-Behind Cache:** Decide whether to update the cache synchronously or asynchronously with the database.

// 5. **Fault Tolerance:**
//    - **Replication:** Replicate data across multiple nodes or data centers to handle node failures.
//    - **Data Backups:** Regularly back up data to prevent data loss in case of failures.
//    - **Failure Detection and Recovery:** Implement mechanisms to detect node failures and automatically recover or reroute requests.

// 6. **Data Operations:**
//    - **CRUD Operations:** Provide basic operations to create, read, update, and delete key-value pairs.
//    - **Batch Operations:** Support batch operations for efficiency (e.g., multi-get, multi-set).
//    - **Transactions:** Optionally support transactions for atomic operations across multiple keys.

// 7. **Security:**
//    - **Access Control:** Implement authentication and authorization mechanisms to control access to data.
//    - **Encryption:** Encrypt data at rest and in transit to protect sensitive information.
//    - **Audit Logging:** Maintain logs of all access and modification operations for auditing purposes.

// 8. **Scalability:**
//    - **Horizontal Scaling:** Add more nodes to distribute the load and handle more data.
//    - **Elastic Scaling:** Dynamically scale the system based on load, adding or removing nodes as needed.
//    - **Load Balancing:** Distribute requests evenly across nodes to prevent any single node from becoming a bottleneck.

// 9. **Monitoring and Maintenance:**
//    - **Real-Time Monitoring:** Track key metrics like request latency, error rates, and resource usage.
//    - **Alerting:** Set up alerts for anomalies like high latency, node failures, or data corruption.
//    - **Auto-Recovery:** Implement self-healing mechanisms to automatically recover from common failures.

// 10. **Data Migration and Upgrades:**
//    - **Data Migration:** Plan for smooth data migration during shard rebalancing or system upgrades.
//    - **Versioning:** Support versioning of keys to handle schema changes or rollbacks.
//    - **Zero-Downtime Upgrades:** Implement strategies to upgrade the system without downtime.
