// Leaderboard System Design
//* https://systemdesign.one/leaderboard-system-design/

// 1. **Data Structure:**
//    - **Sorted Set:** Use a data structure like a sorted set to store user scores in a way that allows efficient ranking.
//    - **Key-Value Store:** Store user IDs as keys and their scores as values, with the ability to sort by scores.

// 2. **Ranking and Scores:**
//    - **Real-Time Updates:** Update scores and rankings in real-time as users play the game or earn points.
//    - **Rank Calculation:** Efficiently calculate ranks based on scores, typically using a sorted set or priority queue.
//    - **Tie Handling:** Decide how to handle ties (e.g., users with the same score have the same rank, or rank by first to reach the score).

// 3. **Data Partitioning:**
//    - **Sharding:** Distribute the leaderboard across multiple servers based on user IDs or score ranges to handle large datasets.
//    - **Replication:** Replicate data across servers for fault tolerance and high availability.

// 4. **Caching:**
//    - **In-Memory Cache:** Use an in-memory cache (e.g., Redis) to store leaderboard data for fast read access.
//    - **Cache Invalidation:** Implement cache invalidation strategies to ensure the leaderboard reflects the latest scores.

// 5. **Query Optimization:**
//    - **Top N Query:** Efficiently retrieve the top N users from the leaderboard (e.g., top 10 players).
//    - **User Ranking Query:** Efficiently retrieve the rank of a specific user.
//    - **Pagination:** Implement pagination to allow users to browse the leaderboard in chunks (e.g., 10 users at a time).

// 6. **Consistency and Concurrency:**
//    - **Eventual Consistency:** Allow slight delays in rank updates for better performance in a distributed system.
//    - **Optimistic Locking:** Use optimistic locking techniques to handle concurrent updates to the same score.

// 7. **Scaling:**
//    - **Horizontal Scaling:** Scale out by adding more servers or nodes as the number of users grows.
//    - **Vertical Scaling:** Scale up by increasing the resources (e.g., CPU, memory) of existing servers.

// 8. **Fault Tolerance:**
//    - **Replication:** Replicate leaderboard data across multiple nodes to handle server failures.
//    - **Backup and Recovery:** Regularly back up leaderboard data and implement recovery procedures to restore data in case of failures.

// 9. **Security:**
//    - **Access Control:** Restrict access to leaderboard data to authorized users or systems.
//    - **Data Integrity:** Ensure the integrity of scores and rankings to prevent tampering or cheating.
//    - **Audit Logging:** Log changes to leaderboard data for auditing and detecting suspicious activities.

// 10. **User Experience:**
//    - **Real-Time Feedback:** Provide real-time feedback to users as their scores and ranks change.
//    - **Personalized Views:** Allow users to view their rank and score relative to their friends or within specific groups.
//    - **Leaderboard Customization:** Support different types of leaderboards (e.g., daily, weekly, all-time) and filters (e.g., regional, by skill level).
