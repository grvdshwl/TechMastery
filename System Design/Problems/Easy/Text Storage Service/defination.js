/**
 * A Text Storage Service is a system designed to store, manage, and retrieve textual data
 * efficiently. This service is often used to handle large volumes of text, such as documents,
 * logs, or configuration files, and provides functionalities for indexing, searching, and
 * managing text data.
 *
 * Key Characteristics:
 * - **Text Storage**: Stores various types of textual data, including documents, logs, or user
 *   inputs, in a structured or unstructured format.
 * - **Indexing**: Creates indexes to enable fast search and retrieval of text data based on
 *   keywords, phrases, or metadata.
 * - **Search and Query**: Provides capabilities for searching and querying text data using different
 *   criteria, such as full-text search or pattern matching.
 * - **Scalability**: Can scale to handle large volumes of text data and high query loads.
 *
 * How It Works:
 * - **Data Ingestion**: Accepts and stores text data from various sources, such as files, user inputs,
 *   or APIs.
 *
 * - **Indexing**: Processes and indexes the text data to facilitate efficient searching and retrieval.
 *   Indexes may include tokenization, stemming, or other text processing techniques.
 *
 * - **Search and Retrieval**: Allows users to perform searches and queries on the indexed text data
 *   to find relevant information quickly.
 *
 * - **Data Management**: Supports operations such as updating, deleting, or organizing text data
 *   based on user requirements or application needs.
 *
 * - **Operations**:
 *   - **Store**: Adds new text data to the storage system.
 *   - **Retrieve**: Retrieves text data based on search queries or identifiers.
 *   - **Update**: Modifies existing text data.
 *   - **Delete**: Removes text data from the storage system.
 *   - **Search**: Performs searches on the indexed text data.
 *
 * Example Use Case:
 * - **Document Management**: Storing and managing large volumes of documents with search and retrieval
 *   capabilities.
 * - **Log Management**: Collecting and analyzing log files for monitoring and troubleshooting purposes.
 * - **Content Management Systems (CMS)**: Handling textual content for websites or applications, including
 *   articles, blogs, and user-generated content.
