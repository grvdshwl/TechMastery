/**
 * A Text URL Shortener is a service that converts long URLs into shorter, more manageable links.
 * This is useful for sharing links in contexts where space is limited or for creating easier-to-remember
 * URLs. The shortened URL typically redirects users to the original long URL when accessed.
 *
 * Key Characteristics:
 * - **Shortened URL Generation**: Converts long URLs into short, unique identifiers that redirect
 *   to the original URL.
 * - **Redirection**: Redirects users from the shortened URL to the original long URL.
 * - **Tracking and Analytics**: Often includes features for tracking click-through rates, user interactions,
 *   and other metrics related to the shortened URL.
 * - **Customization**: May allow customization of the shortened URL or alias for easier recall or branding.
 *
 * How It Works:
 * - **URL Shortening**: Accepts a long URL as input and generates a shorter, unique URL. The shortened
 *   URL is usually a combination of a base URL and a unique identifier or hash.
 *
 * - **Redirection**: When a user accesses the shortened URL, the service looks up the corresponding
 *   long URL and redirects the user to that original address.
 *
 * - **Tracking**: Monitors and records interactions with the shortened URL, such as the number of clicks,
 *   geographic location of users, and referral sources.
 *
 * - **Customization (Optional)**: Allows users to customize the shortened URL or alias, providing
 *   more meaningful or branded links.
 *
 * - **Operations**:
 *   - **Shorten URL**: Creates a short URL from a given long URL.
 *   - **Redirect**: Redirects users from the short URL to the original long URL.
 *   - **Track Clicks**: Provides analytics and reports on user interactions with the shortened URL.
 *   - **Customize URL**: Allows users to set a custom alias for the shortened URL.
 *
 * Example Use Case:
 * - **Social Media**: Sharing long URLs in a more compact form on platforms with character limits.
 * - **Marketing Campaigns**: Creating branded or easy-to-remember URLs for promotional purposes.
 * - **Analytics**: Tracking user engagement and interaction with links in marketing and communication efforts.
