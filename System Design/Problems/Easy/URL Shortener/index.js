// URL Shortener System Design

// 1. **Core Functionality:**
//    - **Shortening URLs:** Provide a mechanism to convert long URLs into shorter, fixed-length URLs.
//    - **Redirecting URLs:** When a user visits the short URL, redirect them to the original long URL.
//    - **Custom Aliases:** Allow users to create custom aliases for their shortened URLs.

// 2. **Data Storage:**
//    - **Key-Value Store:** Use a key-value store (like Redis, DynamoDB) where the key is the short URL code and the value is the original long URL.
//    - **Unique Code Generation:** Generate a unique, short code for each URL. This can be done using techniques like Base62 encoding or hashing.
//    - **Expiration:** Optionally support URL expiration by storing timestamps and automatically deleting expired entries.

// 3. **Code Generation Strategy:**
//    - **Hashing:** Use a hashing algorithm (e.g., MD5, SHA256) on the original URL and encode the result using Base62 to generate a short code.
//    - **Incremental IDs:** Alternatively, use a simple incremental ID counter, encoding the numeric value using Base62 to produce the short code.
//    - **Collision Handling:** Implement collision detection to handle cases where different URLs generate the same short code.

// 4. **Scalability:**
//    - **Partitioning:** Partition data based on the short code or user ID to distribute the load across multiple storage nodes.
//    - **Load Balancing:** Use load balancers to distribute traffic evenly across servers handling the URL shortening and redirection services.
//    - **Caching:** Implement caching for frequently accessed URLs to reduce load on the storage backend and improve performance.

// 5. **Security and Abuse Prevention:**
//    - **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse by limiting the number of URL shortening requests per user or IP address.
//    - **Blacklist and Filtering:** Maintain a blacklist of malicious domains or URLs and filter them out to prevent abuse.
//    - **User Authentication:** Optionally require user authentication for creating and managing shortened URLs, especially for custom aliases.

// 6. **Analytics and Monitoring:**
//    - **Click Tracking:** Track the number of clicks for each shortened URL, including metadata such as timestamp, location, and referrer.
//    - **Real-Time Monitoring:** Monitor the service's health and performance in real-time, setting up alerts for issues like high latency or errors.
//    - **Reporting:** Provide users with analytics dashboards showing usage statistics for their shortened URLs.

// 7. **Custom Domain Support:**
//    - **Custom Domains:** Allow users to use their own custom domains for shortened URLs (e.g., "mydomain.com/shortcode").
//    - **DNS Configuration:** Provide instructions for configuring DNS records to point to the URL shortener service, enabling custom domains.

// 8. **Redundancy and Backup:**
//    - **Data Replication:** Replicate data across multiple nodes or data centers to ensure availability and durability.
//    - **Backups:** Regularly back up the URL mapping data to prevent data loss in case of failures.
//    - **Failover:** Implement failover mechanisms to redirect traffic to backup servers in case of primary server failure.

// 9. **User Experience:**
//    - **Simple Interface:** Provide a user-friendly interface for shortening URLs, managing shortened links, and viewing analytics.
//    - **Error Handling:** Implement clear and informative error messages for scenarios like invalid URLs or short codes not found.
//    - **Customizable:** Allow users to customize their short URLs with meaningful aliases, especially for branding purposes.

// 10. **API and Integration:**
//    - **REST API:** Provide a RESTful API that allows developers to integrate the URL shortening service into their own applications.
//    - **OAuth:** Implement OAuth for secure API access, enabling third-party apps to create and manage shortened URLs on behalf of users.
//    - **Webhook Support:** Offer webhooks to notify users when certain events occur, like a URL being clicked or expiring.
