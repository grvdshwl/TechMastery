// What is Chaos Monkey?

// Chaos Monkey is a tool originally developed by Netflix to test the resilience of their cloud infrastructure.
// It randomly terminates instances of services to ensure that the system can handle failures gracefully.

// Key Features:

// 1. Random Failures:
// Chaos Monkey introduces random failures in the system by shutting down instances of services. This tests the
// system's ability to recover and continue operating smoothly.

// 2. Resilience Testing:
// By causing failures, Chaos Monkey helps identify weaknesses in the system. It ensures that services are
// fault-tolerant and can handle unexpected issues.

// 3. Automated Testing:
// Chaos Monkey runs automatically, introducing failures at random times. This means the system is continually
// tested for resilience without manual intervention.

// 4. Increased Confidence:
// Regularly testing with Chaos Monkey increases confidence in the system's robustness and reliability.
// It helps ensure that the system can withstand real-world issues.

// How It Works:

// 1. Selecting Targets:
// Chaos Monkey selects instances of services running in the system. These instances are the targets for random termination.

// 2. Terminating Instances:
// Chaos Monkey shuts down the selected instances. This simulates failures and tests how well the system handles them.

// 3. Monitoring and Recovery:
// The system's monitoring tools and recovery mechanisms detect the failures and take action to restore normal operation.

// In Summary:

// Chaos Monkey is a tool used to test the resilience of a system by introducing random failures. It selects service instances,
// terminates them, and monitors how well the system recovers. This helps identify weaknesses and improve the fault tolerance of
// the system, ensuring it can handle unexpected issues in a real-world environment.
