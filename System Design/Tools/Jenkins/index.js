// What is Jenkins?

// Jenkins is an open-source automation server used for continuous integration (CI) and continuous delivery (CD).
// It helps automate the building, testing, and deployment of software, facilitating DevOps practices.

// Key Features:

// 1. Continuous Integration (CI):
// Jenkins automates the process of integrating code changes from multiple contributors into a shared repository
// frequently. This helps detect issues early and improve code quality.

// 2. Continuous Delivery (CD):
// Jenkins automates the deployment of applications to different environments (e.g., staging, production)
// after they pass automated tests. This ensures that new features and fixes are delivered quickly and reliably.

// 3. Extensibility:
// Jenkins has a rich ecosystem of plugins that extend its functionality. You can integrate it with version control systems,
// build tools, testing frameworks, and deployment tools.

// 4. Pipeline as Code:
// Jenkins supports defining build and deployment pipelines as code using the Jenkinsfile, allowing version control
// and easy management of CI/CD processes.

// 5. Distributed Builds:
// Jenkins can distribute build and test workloads across multiple machines (nodes) to speed up the process and handle
// large-scale projects more efficiently.

// How It Works:

// 1. Jenkins Master:
// The Jenkins master server manages and orchestrates the build and deployment processes. It schedules and coordinates
// jobs (build tasks) and provides the web interface for users to configure and monitor these jobs.

// 2. Jenkins Nodes:
// Jenkins nodes (also known as slaves or agents) are additional machines that execute build tasks. The master distributes
// tasks to these nodes to perform the actual work.

// 3. Jobs and Pipelines:
// Jenkins jobs are individual tasks or workflows, such as building a project or running tests. Pipelines define a series
// of steps to be executed in sequence or parallel, such as building, testing, and deploying the application.

// Example Jenkinsfile (Pipeline as Code):
const Jenkinsfile = `
pipeline {
    agent any
    
    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                echo 'Building...'
                sh 'make build'
            }
        }
        
        stage('Test') {
            steps {
                echo 'Testing...'
                sh 'make test'
            }
        }
        
        stage('Deploy') {
            steps {
                echo 'Deploying...'
                sh 'make deploy'
            }
        }
    }
}
`;

// 4. Triggers:
// Jenkins can automatically trigger jobs based on various events, such as code commits, pull requests, or scheduled intervals.

// Example Trigger:
const triggerConfig = `
triggers {
    pollSCM('H/15 * * * *')  // Poll SCM every 15 minutes
}
`;

// Example Usage:

// 1. Automating Build and Test:
// Jenkins can automatically build and test code whenever changes are made to the repository, ensuring that issues are detected early.

// 2. Continuous Deployment:
// Jenkins can deploy applications to staging or production environments automatically after passing tests, ensuring quick and reliable releases.

// 3. Integration with Other Tools:
// Jenkins integrates with various tools and services, such as version control systems (e.g., Git), build tools (e.g., Maven),
// and deployment platforms (e.g., Kubernetes), to create a complete CI/CD pipeline.

// 4. Customizable Workflows:
// Jenkins pipelines can be customized to fit different workflows, such as multi-stage deployments, complex build processes,
// and integration with external tools and services.

// In Summary:

// Jenkins is a versatile automation server that streamlines the CI/CD process by automating build, test, and deployment tasks.
// Its extensibility through plugins, support for pipelines as code, and ability to distribute workloads make it a powerful tool
// for modern software development and DevOps practices.
