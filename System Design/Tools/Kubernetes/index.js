// What is Kubernetes?

// Kubernetes, often abbreviated as K8s, is an open-source platform for automating the deployment, scaling,
// and management of containerized applications. It orchestrates the operation of containers across a cluster of machines.

// Key Features:

// 1. Automated Deployment and Scaling:
// Kubernetes automates the deployment of containers and can automatically scale up or down based on traffic or resource usage.

// 2. Container Orchestration:
// It manages the lifecycle of containers, ensuring that they are running as intended, and restarting them if they fail.

// 3. Load Balancing and Service Discovery:
// Kubernetes provides built-in load balancing, distributing traffic across containers and ensuring high availability.
// It also makes it easy to discover and connect to services within the cluster.

// 4. Storage Orchestration:
// It can automatically mount storage systems like local storage, cloud providers, and network storage to containers.

// 5. Self-Healing:
// Kubernetes can automatically replace and reschedule containers that fail, become unresponsive, or are terminated.

// 6. Secret and Configuration Management:
// It allows you to manage sensitive information, such as passwords, OAuth tokens, and SSH keys, as well as application configuration.

/* How It Works: */

// 1. Cluster:
// A Kubernetes cluster consists of a master node (control plane) and worker nodes. The master node manages the cluster,
// while worker nodes run the containerized applications.

// 2. Pods:
// The smallest deployable unit in Kubernetes is a pod. A pod can contain one or more containers that share storage,
// network, and a specification for how to run the containers.

// 3. Deployments:
// A deployment defines the desired state for your application, such as the number of replicas. Kubernetes ensures that
// the actual state matches the desired state by creating or deleting pods as needed.

// Example deployment in YAML format:
const deploymentYAML = `
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: my-app
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: my-app
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: my-app
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: my-app-container
        image: my-app-image:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8080
`;

// 4. Services:
// A service in Kubernetes is an abstraction that defines a logical set of pods and a policy by which to access them.
// It enables communication between different parts of the application and with external clients.

// 5. ConfigMaps and Secrets:
// ConfigMaps are used to store non-confidential configuration data, while Secrets are used for sensitive data.
// Both can be injected into pods as environment variables or mounted as files.

// Example Usage:

// 1. Containerized Application Deployment:
// Kubernetes automates the deployment and scaling of containerized applications. Developers can define the desired state
// of the application, and Kubernetes ensures it is maintained.

// 2. Microservices Management:
// Kubernetes is ideal for managing microservices architectures. Each microservice can run in its own set of pods,
// and Kubernetes handles their scaling, networking, and resilience.

// 3. Continuous Deployment (CD):
// Kubernetes integrates with CI/CD pipelines to enable continuous deployment. It can deploy new versions of an application,
// roll back to previous versions if needed, and perform rolling updates with zero downtime.

// 4. Hybrid and Multi-Cloud Deployments:
// Kubernetes abstracts the underlying infrastructure, allowing applications to be deployed across on-premises,
// hybrid, and multi-cloud environments seamlessly.

// In Summary:

// Kubernetes is a powerful orchestration platform for managing containerized applications. It automates deployment,
// scaling, and management, ensuring that applications run reliably and efficiently. Kubernetes supports various use
// cases, from simple application deployment to complex microservices architectures, making it a key tool in modern
// DevOps and cloud-native development.
