// ZooKeeper is a centralized service used in distributed systems for
// maintaining configuration information, naming, providing distributed
// synchronization, and group services.
// What is ZooKeeper?

// ZooKeeper is like a reliable helper for computers that need to work together.
// It makes sure they stay organized and know what to do.

// Key Features:

// 1. Central Command Center:
// ZooKeeper acts like a command center where all the important settings are stored.
// All the computers can check here to get the latest instructions.

// 2. Keeping Things in Order:
// It helps keep tasks organized, ensuring that multiple computers don’t try to
// do the same thing at the same time.

// 3. Name Directory:
// ZooKeeper has a directory where computers can look up where to find things they need.

// 4. Group Management:
// It helps manage groups of computers, like choosing a leader among them to
// take charge of certain tasks.

// 5. Fast and Reliable:
// ZooKeeper is built to be very fast and dependable, so it can handle a lot of
// requests without slowing down.

// How It Works:

// 1. Configurations:
// All the settings and configurations are kept in ZooKeeper, so any computer
// can get the latest information easily.

// 2. Leader Election:
// If a group of computers needs a leader to coordinate their tasks, ZooKeeper
// can help them pick one.

// 3. Locking:
// When computers need to access the same resource, ZooKeeper makes sure they
// take turns to avoid conflicts.

// 4. Cluster Management:
// ZooKeeper keeps track of which computers are available and working properly.

// Example:

// Imagine you have a group of computers that need to process data:

// 1. Central Settings:
// All the computers read their instructions from ZooKeeper, so they know
// how to process the data.

// 2. Choosing a Leader:
// ZooKeeper helps the computers decide which one should be the leader to
// organize the data processing.

// 3. Organized Tasks:
// ZooKeeper ensures that each computer processes a different part of the data,
// avoiding duplication.

// In Summary:

// ZooKeeper is like a smart organizer for a team of computers. It keeps everything
// in order, helps them work together without stepping on each other’s toes,
// and makes sure they have the latest information to do their jobs efficiently.

// Example Usage:

// Consider a distributed application with multiple servers needing coordination.
// ZooKeeper can be used to:

// 1. Elect a Leader:
// One server can be elected as a leader to coordinate tasks.

// 2. Manage Configuration:
// All servers can read configuration data from ZooKeeper to ensure they
// are using the same settings.

// 3. Synchronize Tasks:
// Servers can use ZooKeeper to ensure tasks are executed in the correct
// order without conflicts.

// In summary, ZooKeeper is a fundamental tool for distributed systems,
// providing essential services for coordination, configuration, and synchronization.
