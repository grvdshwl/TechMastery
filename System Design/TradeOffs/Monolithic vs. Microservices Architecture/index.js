/**
 * System Design: Monolithic vs. Microservices Architecture
 *
 * Monolithic Architecture:
 * - In a monolithic architecture, all components of an application (e.g., UI, business logic, database access) are part of a single, unified codebase.
 * - The entire application is deployed as a single unit, meaning changes to one part of the application require redeploying the entire system.
 *
 * Characteristics:
 * - **Single Codebase**: All features and services live within a single codebase.
 * - **Tightly Coupled**: Components are tightly integrated and share memory and resources.
 * - **Single Deployment**: The application is built, tested, and deployed as a single unit.
 * - **Shared Resources**: All modules share a common database and server environment.
 *
 * Example:
 * - A monolithic e-commerce application might have the product catalog, user authentication, and payment processing in the same codebase.
 *
 * Advantages of Monolithic Architecture:
 * - **Simpler Development**: Easy to build, deploy, and maintain, especially in the early stages of an application.
 * - **Easier Testing**: Testing is straightforward since the entire application can be tested in one environment.
 * - **Fewer Cross-Cutting Concerns**: No need to manage inter-service communication, as all functionality resides in one place.
 *
 * Disadvantages of Monolithic Architecture:
 * - **Scaling Issues**: Hard to scale individual components independently; the entire application must be scaled together.
 * - **Slower Deployment**: Small changes require redeploying the entire application, increasing downtime and risk.
 * - **Limited Flexibility**: Different parts of the application must use the same technology stack, limiting innovation.
 * - **Tight Coupling**: A failure in one part of the system can bring down the entire application.
 *
 * Use Cases for Monolithic Architecture:
 * - Simple applications or startups with small teams and limited features.
 * - Applications in the early stages, where simplicity and faster development cycles are key priorities.

/**
 * Microservices Architecture:
 * - In a microservices architecture, the application is broken down into small, independent services, each responsible for a specific function.
 * - Each service is independently deployable, and services communicate with each other through APIs or message queues.
 *
 * Characteristics:
 * - **Independent Services**: Each service represents a specific business functionality and operates independently.
 * - **Loosely Coupled**: Services are loosely coupled and can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently.
 * - **Service Communication**: Services communicate via APIs (typically REST or RPC) or message brokers (e.g., Kafka, RabbitMQ).
 * - **Decentralized Data Management**: Each service may have its own database, ensuring data independence.
 *
 * Example:
 * - In a microservices-based e-commerce app, separate services handle user management, product catalog, payments, and order processing, each deployed and scaled independently.
 *
 * Advantages of Microservices Architecture:
 * - **Independent Scaling**: Services can be scaled individually based on demand, reducing resource waste.
 * - **Faster Deployment**: Independent deployments mean changes in one service donâ€™t affect others, reducing downtime.
 * - **Technological Freedom**: Each service can use different technologies and languages based on its specific needs.
 * - **Resilience**: A failure in one service typically doesn't bring down the entire application, improving fault tolerance.
 * - **Improved Agility**: Teams can work on different services in parallel, enabling faster development cycles.
 *
 * Disadvantages of Microservices Architecture:
 * - **Increased Complexity**: More services mean more moving parts, making management, deployment, and debugging more complex.
 * - **Service Coordination**: Communication between services adds overhead, both in terms of latency and error handling.
 * - **Data Consistency**: Managing consistent data across multiple services and databases can be challenging (eventual consistency).
 * - **Cross-Cutting Concerns**: Handling security, logging, and monitoring across multiple services requires extra work.
 *
 * Use Cases for Microservices Architecture:
 * - Large-scale, complex applications with multiple modules that need to scale independently (e.g., Netflix, Amazon).
 * - Applications with diverse teams working on different features, requiring independent deployment.

/**
 * Monolithic vs. Microservices Architecture:
 * - **Monolithic**: Single codebase, easier to develop and maintain in the early stages but harder to scale and evolve over time.
 * - **Microservices**: Independent services that offer better scalability and flexibility but come with increased complexity.
 *
 * Trade-offs:
 * - **Monolithic**: Easier to develop and manage for small applications or startups, but scaling and maintenance become difficult as the application grows.
 * - **Microservices**: Ideal for large-scale applications where independent scaling and frequent deployments are needed, but requires careful management of inter-service communication, data consistency, and infrastructure.
 *
 * Choosing Between the Two:
 * - **Monolithic**: Best for smaller projects, simpler applications, or early-stage startups that need to move quickly.
 * - **Microservices**: Best for large, complex, or evolving systems where scalability, fault tolerance, and independent deployments are critical.
