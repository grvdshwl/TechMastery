//*Push vs Pull Archtitecture

/**
 * System Design: Push Architecture vs. Pull Architecture
 *
 * Push Architecture:
 * - In a push architecture, the server or central system sends data to the client as soon as it becomes available.
 * - The server initiates the communication, pushing updates without waiting for a client request.
 *
 * Characteristics:
 * - **Server-Initiated**: The server actively sends data to the clients.
 * - **Real-Time Delivery**: Ideal for systems requiring immediate data delivery with minimal delay.
 * - **Connection Persistence**: Often uses persistent connections (e.g., WebSockets, Server-Sent Events) for continuous communication.
 *
 * Examples:
 * - **Notification Systems**: Mobile push notifications that deliver real-time alerts.
 * - **Live Data Feeds**: Stock market tickers, social media updates, or real-time dashboards.
 * - **Streaming Services**: Video and music streaming services delivering continuous content.
 *
 * Advantages of Push Architecture:
 * - **Timely Updates**: Ensures clients receive the latest information immediately.
 * - **Low Latency**: Data is sent as soon as itâ€™s available, reducing waiting time.
 * - **Efficient Resource Utilization**: Reduces unnecessary requests or polling by the client.
 *
 * Disadvantages of Push Architecture:
 * - **Scalability Challenges**: Handling a large number of concurrent clients can be resource-intensive for the server.
 * - **Complex Implementation**: Requires more complex infrastructure for real-time delivery and maintaining persistent connections.
 * - **Network Dependency**: Relies heavily on stable network conditions; poor connections can lead to delayed or missed updates.
 *
 * Use Cases for Push Architecture:
 * - **Real-Time Systems**: Live dashboards, instant messaging, or systems requiring near-instant data delivery.
 * - **Time-Sensitive Data**: Stock price updates, emergency alerts, or sports scores where immediacy is critical.
 * - **Unpredictable Data Sources**: Environments where the timing of data generation is unpredictable.

/**
 * Pull Architecture:
 * - In a pull architecture, the client initiates the request and retrieves data from the server when needed.
 * - The server responds to client requests, delivering only the requested data.
 *
 * Characteristics:
 * - **Client-Initiated**: The client requests data from the server as required.
 * - **On-Demand Data Access**: Clients have control over when to fetch updates or data.
 * - **Polling or Request-Driven**: Often relies on polling intervals or ad-hoc requests from the client.
 *
 * Examples:
 * - **Web Browsing**: A web browser requests pages or resources as the user navigates the internet.
 * - **APIs**: Clients fetch data from RESTful APIs based on specific needs.
 * - **Database Queries**: Applications request specific data from databases as needed.
 *
 * Advantages of Pull Architecture:
 * - **Scalability**: Easier to scale as clients manage their request frequency, reducing the load on the server.
 * - **Simpler Implementation**: Easier to implement, especially for systems with less frequent data updates.
 * - **Client Control**: Clients decide when and what data to request, reducing unnecessary data transfers.
 *
 * Disadvantages of Pull Architecture:
 * - **Higher Latency**: Clients may experience delays between polling intervals or while waiting for the next request cycle.
 * - **Increased Traffic**: Frequent polling can lead to increased network traffic and server load.
 * - **Stale Data**: Clients may receive outdated information between polling cycles, leading to potential inaccuracies in real-time systems.
 *
 * Use Cases for Pull Architecture:
 * - **Non-Real-Time Systems**: Applications where data freshness is not critical and can tolerate some delay in updates.
 * - **Stable Data Sources**: Environments with predictable, infrequent data changes.
 * - **Client-Controlled Data Consumption**: Systems where the client decides how frequently to retrieve data (e.g., user-driven queries).
 */

/**
 * Hybrid Approaches:
 * - Many modern systems use a combination of push and pull architectures to balance real-time updates with client-controlled requests.
 * - Common hybrid patterns include:
 *
 *   - **Long Polling**: The client initiates a connection and holds it open, allowing the server to push data when it becomes available (e.g., real-time notifications).
 *   - **Server-Sent Events (SSE)**: The server pushes data to clients over HTTP in real time, keeping the connection open for continuous updates.
 *   - **WebSockets**: Enables full-duplex communication, allowing for both push and pull interactions over a single persistent connection.
 *   - **Pub/Sub with Pull**: Clients can subscribe to real-time updates (push) but also pull historical or missing data when necessary.
 */

/**
 * Push Architecture vs. Pull Architecture:
 * - **Push Architecture**: Server initiates communication, pushing data to the client in real time.
 * - **Pull Architecture**: Client initiates communication, requesting data from the server on demand.
 *
 * Trade-offs:
 * - **Push Architecture**: Low latency and real-time data delivery but higher complexity and scalability challenges.
 * - **Pull Architecture**: Easier to implement and scale, but may suffer from higher latency and stale data.
 *
 * Choosing Between the Two:
 * - **Push Architecture**: Best for real-time systems where immediacy and low latency are critical.
 * - **Pull Architecture**: Best for non-real-time applications where clients can control their data intake and tolerate some delay.
