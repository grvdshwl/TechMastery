/**
 * Caching Strategies: Read-Through and Write-Through
 *
 * Caching is a technique used to speed up access to data by storing frequently accessed data in a faster storage medium.
 * Among the various caching strategies, Read-Through and Write-Through caching are commonly used patterns.
 *
 * This guide explores these strategies, how they work, their advantages, disadvantages, and use cases.
 */

/**
 * Read-Through Cache
 *
 * A Read-Through cache sits between your application and the data store.
 * When the application requests data, it first checks the cache. If the data is found (cache hit), it's returned.
 * If the data is not in the cache (cache miss), the cache loads the data from the data store, caches it, and then returns it to the application.
 */

/**
 * How Read-Through Cache Works:
 * 1. The application requests data from the cache.
 * 2. If the data is in the cache (cache hit), it's returned immediately.
 * 3. If the data is not in the cache (cache miss):
 *    - The cache requests the data from the underlying data store.
 *    - The data store returns the data to the cache.
 *    - The cache stores the data and returns it to the application.
 */

/**
 * Advantages of Read-Through Cache:
 * - Simplified Application Logic: The application only interacts with the cache, abstracting away the data store.
 * - Consistency: The cache is in sync with the data store for read operations.
 * - Reduced Load on Data Store: Frequently accessed data is served from the cache, reducing the load on the data store.
 */

/**
 * Disadvantages of Read-Through Cache:
 * - Initial Request Latency: The first request for any data (cache miss) will be slower as the data needs to be loaded into the cache.
 * - Data Staleness: If the data in the data store changes, the cache may return stale data until the cached data expires or is invalidated.
 */

/**
 * Use Cases for Read-Through Cache:
 * - Applications with read-heavy workloads.
 * - Scenarios where data doesn't change frequently.
 * - Systems where consistency between cache and data store is crucial for read operations.
 */

/**
 * Write-Through Cache
 *
 * In a Write-Through cache strategy, data is written to both the cache and the data store simultaneously.
 * Every write operation ensures that data is written to both places before considering the write complete.
 */

/**
 * How Write-Through Cache Works:
 * 1. The application writes data to the cache.
 * 2. The cache immediately writes the same data to the underlying data store.
 * 3. The write operation is only considered complete when both writes (to cache and data store) are successful.
 */

/**
 * Advantages of Write-Through Cache:
 * - Data Consistency: The cache is always in sync with the data store since every write is mirrored to both.
 * - Reduced Risk of Data Loss: Writes are persisted to the data store immediately, minimizing the risk of data loss.
 * - Simplified Read Operations: Subsequent reads will always fetch the most recent data from the cache.
 */

/**
 * Disadvantages of Write-Through Cache:
 * - Increased Write Latency: Each write operation involves writing to both the cache and the data store, leading to increased latency.
 * - Higher Resource Usage: More network bandwidth and processing power are required due to the dual write operations.
 */

/**
 * Use Cases for Write-Through Cache:
 * - Applications where data consistency is critical.
 * - Systems that cannot afford data loss in case of cache failures.
 * - Scenarios where read performance after a write operation is crucial.
