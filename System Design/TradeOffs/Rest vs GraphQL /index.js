// Pros of GraphQL:

// Flexible Data Fetching:
// GraphQL allows clients to request exactly the data they need.
// This reduces over-fetching or under-fetching by tailoring the response to the client's needs.

// Single Endpoint:
// GraphQL uses a single endpoint to handle all queries and mutations, simplifying the API structure.

// No Versioning Required:
// With GraphQL, API evolution happens without needing versioning.
// New fields can be added, and deprecated fields can be left in place without breaking existing clients.

// Real-Time Support:
// GraphQL natively supports real-time data fetching through subscriptions.
// This makes it easier to implement real-time features like live updates.

// Type Safety:
// GraphQL has a strongly typed schema, making it clear what data is available and in what format.
// Clients can easily understand what fields and types are accessible via introspection.

// Cons of GraphQL:

// Complexity:
// GraphQL has a steep learning curve, requiring developers to learn schemas, queries, and resolvers.
// It demands more initial setup compared to REST, especially for simple APIs.

// Performance Issues with Large Queries:
// GraphQL allows clients to ask for deeply nested or large amounts of data, which can lead to performance bottlenecks if not controlled properly.

// Caching Complexity:
// Unlike REST, GraphQL doesn't have built-in HTTP caching due to its single endpoint structure.
// Special tools like Apollo are often needed to manage caching effectively.

// Query Abuse:
// GraphQL queries can be complex and expensive, increasing the risk of performance issues if clients request too much data.
// Developers need to implement query complexity controls to prevent abuse.

// Overhead for Simple APIs:
// For simple applications or basic CRUD operations, GraphQL may add unnecessary complexity.
// REST can be simpler and more efficient for straightforward APIs.

// Pros of REST:

// Simplicity:
// REST is simple to understand and implement, using standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
// Ideal for smaller, less complex applications.

// Built-In HTTP Features:
// REST supports caching, versioning, and status codes out of the box with standard HTTP.
// This simplifies caching responses and managing updates across versions.

// Mature Ecosystem:
// REST has been around for a long time and has a wide range of libraries, tools, and best practices available.
// This makes it easier to implement and maintain for developers.

// Clear Separation of Concerns:
// Multiple endpoints clearly represent different resources and actions.
// This makes the API structure intuitive and easy to reason about.

// Cons of REST:

// Over-fetching and Under-fetching:
// Over-fetching: REST may return more data than needed, leading to inefficient data usage.
// Under-fetching: Clients may need to make multiple requests to gather related data, which can increase latency.

// Multiple Endpoints:
// REST APIs often require numerous endpoints for different resources and operations.
// This can make maintenance difficult as the number of endpoints grows, especially when updating the data model.

// Versioning:
// Versioning REST APIs (e.g., /v1, /v2) can lead to fragmentation.
// Different clients may use different versions, making it harder to maintain backward compatibility.

// Limited Query Flexibility:
// REST has fixed responses for each endpoint, limiting the flexibility for clients to request specific subsets of data.
// Clients often receive unnecessary data or need multiple calls to fetch what they require.

// Lack of Type Safety:
// REST APIs don't typically enforce strict schemas.
// Clients may not know exactly what data to expect or send, leading to potential mismatches between client and server.

// Real-Time Support:
// REST is not inherently designed for real-time communication.
// Implementing real-time features like subscriptions or notifications usually requires workarounds such as polling or using WebSockets alongside the REST API.

// Handling Complex Relationships:
// REST APIs can struggle with handling complex relationships between resources.
// Fetching related data often requires multiple round trips, increasing latency and complexity.

// State Transitions:
// REST's stateless nature means each request must carry all necessary information, such as authentication tokens.
// This can result in redundant data being sent with every request, increasing overhead.
