/**
 * Stateful Design
 *
 * In a stateful design, the system remembers client data from one request to the next.
 * It maintains a record of the client's state, which can include session information, transaction details,
 * or any other data relevant to the ongoing interaction.
 *
 * Example: During online shopping, when you add items to your cart, the website remembers your selections.
 * Even if you navigate away, the items are still there when you return to the cart.
 */

/**
 * Advantages of Stateful Design:
 * - Personalized Experiences: Delivers tailored interactions by remembering user preferences and past actions.
 * - Contextual Continuity: Users can seamlessly resume activities where they left off, even after disconnecting.
 * - Reduced Round Trips: Operations can be faster since the server already possesses the necessary data.
 */

/**
 * Challenges of Stateful Design:
 * - Scalability: Maintaining state for a large number of users can become resource-intensive and complex.
 * - Complexity: Managing and synchronizing state across multiple servers adds additional challenges.
 * - Failure Points: If a server holding a user's state fails, their session data may be lost.
 */

/**
 * When to Use Stateful Services:
 * - Personalized User Experiences: Applications that require user-specific data, such as e-commerce websites, social media, and online gaming.
 * - Transactional Operations: Systems needing consistent state and transactional integrity, like banking apps or inventory management.
 * - Real-Time Collaboration: Services like collaborative document editing where state synchronization is crucial.
 */

/**
 * Stateless Design
 *
 * Stateless design treats each request as an independent transaction.
 * The server does not store any information about the client's state between requests.
 * Each request must contain all the information necessary to understand and process it.
 *
 * Example: RESTful web services, where each request is self-contained.
 * For example, querying a public API for weather information where the request provides all necessary details each time.
 */

/**
 * Advantages of Stateless Design:
 * - Scalability: Stateless systems are easier to scale horizontally, as new servers can be added effortlessly.
 * - Simplicity: The architecture is simpler since servers don't need to maintain user sessions.
 * - Resilience: Server failures don't disrupt user sessions, as data isn't tied to specific servers.
 */

/**
 * Challenges of Stateless Design:
 * - Less Context: Stateless systems lack personalization and context awareness without additional mechanisms (like cookies or tokens).
 * - Increased Data Transfer: Every request must carry all required information, potentially increasing the payload size.
 */

/**
 * Examples of Stateless Services:
 * - RESTful APIs: Where each request is independent and self-contained.
 * - Microservices: Often use stateless services for better scalability and fault tolerance.
 * - CDNs: Content Delivery Networks that serve static content without maintaining client state.
 */

/**
 * When to Use Stateless Services:
 * - Microservices Architecture: For building scalable, resilient applications where services can be independently deployed and scaled.
 * - APIs and Web Services: RESTful APIs and web services where each request is self-contained.
 * - High Traffic Websites: Applications handling large volumes of traffic efficiently, such as content-heavy websites and CDNs.
 */

/**
 * Choosing the Right Approach:
 * There's no one-size-fits-all answer when choosing between stateful and stateless architectures.
 *
 * - Prioritize user experience and personalization? Stateful might be better.
 * - Need seamless scalability? Stateless is often the preferred choice.
 *
 * Hybrid Approaches: Sometimes, a combination of both stateful and stateless components can be effective.
