/**
 * Consistency Models in Distributed Systems
 *
 * In the world of distributed systems, consistency models are essential for understanding how data is read and written across multiple nodes.
 * Two primary models of consistency are strong consistency and eventual consistency.
 *
 * This guide explores these consistency models, their advantages, disadvantages, and when to use each one.
 */

/**
 * What is Consistency in Distributed Systems?
 * Consistency refers to the guarantee that all nodes in a distributed system will have the same data at the same time.
 * When a system is consistent, every read operation returns the most recent write for a given piece of data.
 */

/**
 * Strong Consistency
 *
 * Strong consistency ensures that any read operation returns the most recent write for a piece of data.
 * Once a write is acknowledged, all subsequent reads will reflect that write.
 */

/**
 * How Strong Consistency Works:
 * - Atomic Writes: Every write operation is atomic and immediately visible to all nodes.
 * - Read-After-Write: After a successful write, any subsequent read will return the updated value.
 * - Synchronous Replication: Data is replicated to all nodes before the write is considered complete.
 */

/**
 * Pros of Strong Consistency:
 * - Simplicity for Developers: No need to handle stale reads or data conflicts.
 * - Data Integrity: Ensures the highest level of data integrity and reliability.
 * - Predictable Behavior: Guarantees all nodes have the same data at the same time, critical for certain applications.
 */

/**
 * Cons of Strong Consistency:
 * - Latency: Synchronous replication can result in higher latencies as the system waits for all nodes to acknowledge the write.
 * - Availability Trade-offs: In a partitioned network, the system may become unavailable to maintain consistency (as per the CAP theorem).
 * - Scalability: Can be challenging to scale due to the overhead of ensuring all nodes are in sync.
 */

/**
 * Use Cases for Strong Consistency:
 * - Financial Systems: Where accurate and up-to-date information is crucial.
 * - Inventory Management: Where real-time stock levels must be maintained to avoid overselling.
 * - Booking Systems: Such as airline reservations where double-booking must be prevented.
 */

/**
 * Eventual Consistency
 *
 * Eventual consistency ensures that, given enough time, all nodes will converge to the same value.
 * However, there is no guarantee of when this convergence will happen.
 * This model is commonly used in systems that prioritize high availability and partition tolerance over immediate consistency.
 */

/**
 * How Eventual Consistency Works:
 * - Asynchronous Replication: Writes are propagated to other nodes asynchronously.
 * - Temporary Inconsistency: Reads may return stale data until all nodes are updated.
 * - Conflict Resolution: Mechanisms are needed to handle conflicts that arise from concurrent writes.
 */

/**
 * Pros of Eventual Consistency:
 * - Low Latency: Asynchronous replication can lead to faster write operations.
 * - High Availability: The system remains available even during network partitions.
 * - Scalability: Easier to scale, as nodes can operate independently and eventually converge.
 */

/**
 * Cons of Eventual Consistency:
 * - Complexity for Developers: Developers must handle stale reads and resolve data conflicts.
 * - Data Integrity: There is a risk of temporary inconsistencies and potential data loss.
 * - Unpredictable Behavior: Applications must be designed to tolerate eventual consistency.
 */

/**
 * Use Cases for Eventual Consistency:
 * - Social Media: Where real-time updates are less critical, and availability and partition tolerance are prioritized.
 * - Content Delivery Networks (CDNs): Where low latency is crucial, and eventual consistency is acceptable.
 * - E-commerce: For non-critical data such as product recommendations and user reviews.
